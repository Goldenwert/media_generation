    "text": "More than half of Gen Zers want to be full-time influencers, a recent Morning Consult poll found, and it's not hard to see why. They've grown up watching their peers on YouTube film makeup tutorials, narrate their \"Fortnite\" games, and explain money. It's both where they live their lives and where they learn about the world. Plus, the career path sounds like a dream: You get to be your own boss, you can make more than you could at a traditional job, and you just have to be good on camera. Success stories of influencers making millions of dollars have only galvanized the generation.\n\"Gen Z explicitly wants to become influencers, are trained to become influencers, do camps to become influencers, strategize in a variety of ways to become an influencer,\" Ang\u00e8le Christin, a professor at Stanford studying the influencer industry, told me.\nA decade ago, many successful influencers stumbled into fame; they were just regular people sharing about their lives or showcasing a niche skill when they suddenly found themselves with a huge audience and brands desperate to work with them. Anyone could strike it lucky at any time. But over the past several years, the influencer economy has shifted. Gone are the days when casual posting could suddenly turn into a lucrative career. On top of the work being an influencer requires, the competition gets tougher each day as more people vie for fame.\nTo make matters worse, influencer wannabes aren't competing only with humans \u2014 they're soon going to be competing with artificial intelligence. Advancements in AI tech have given birth to an industry of AI influencers, and major companies are beginning to show interest in their far more cost-effective approach to marketing. And who can really compete with that?\nThe influencer market is thoroughly saturated, Nikita Baklanov, an analyst at the influencer-marketing company HypeAuditor, said. Out of Instagram's some 2 billion monthly active users, \"only 800,000 accounts have over 100,000 followers,\" he said, citing his company's research. That's less than 1% of accounts \u2014 but still a lot of accounts. And the number is growing.\nIn a crowded field, standing out takes work. Julia Broome, a social-media manager for influencers and celebrities, is already seeing the impact on longtime influencers. \"Creators that were able to get a big buzz or get a huge following back in the day, they're experiencing some drop-off,\" she said.\nToday, most influencers need to have a variety of revenue streams to stay financially viable, Baklanov said. They need to offer subscriptions, create their own merch, or sell a course. Increasingly, they need to exist beyond social media. \"Platforms keep changing. The algorithms keep on changing. The formats keep on changing. And at some point, the influencers realize that they have to build a loyal audience, and they have to take that audience outside of social-media platforms,\" Christin, the Stanford professor, told me. That means setting up a podcast, running events, or creating a newsletter.\nWith tools like the AI image generator Midjourney and OpenAI's forthcoming Sora, creating content is becoming much-more affordable. \nA Wall Street Journal article from 2021 suggested that the chances of making enough money from TikTok influencing for it to be an at least five-year career were less than 0.0001%. Only 100 people out of more than 1 million will succeed.\nAs the career path slips further out of reach, some people are turning to creating user-generated content for brands, rather than for their own audiences. Broome told me she'd seen a \"big surge in UGC creators,\" who come at a much-lower cost to brands than traditional influencers. For creators, it's a nice way to make some money, but if your dream is to call your own shots for your own fan community, it's not a good sign. And now AI is poised to be another threat to job opportunities.\nIn 2016, Miquela Sousa, aka Lil Miquela, was born, as a fully formed Brazilian American 19-year-old. With 2.7 million followers on Instagram Miquela has been reported to rake in over $10 million a year in brand deals, with campaigns for Prada and Calvin Klein. She, however, is not a real person.\nShe is one of roughly 200 virtual influencers, according to Virtual Humans, a site that tracks these faux influencers, fueled by advanced motion graphics and a sizable team of people. Along with others, like Imma, who gets millions of views on TikTok, and Shudu, a virtual model, she proved people were willing to engage with someone who wasn't exactly real.\nMiquela's success didn't spark a virtual-influencer revolution, but that was largely because of cost \u2014 human influencers were still cheaper. In the past couple of years, however, AI has advanced enough to make digital influencers much easier to create and run. With tools like the AI image generator Midjourney and OpenAI's forthcoming Sora, which makes extremely realistic videos from text prompts, creating content is becoming much-more affordable. \"It costs almost nothing,\" Baklanov of HypeAuditor said. \"And they can actually duplicate it in different languages.\"\nAI-generated model Aitana has 200,000 Instagram followers and reportedly makes $11,000 a month with brand deals. The Clueless Agency \nCompanies have been quick to capitalize on the potential. Late last year, Meta announced \"a universe of characters,\" fueled by AI, with Instagram and Facebook accounts you could message with. \"We've been creating AIs that have more personality, opinions, and interests, and are a bit more fun to interact with,\" the announcement said. An AI-model agency called The Clueless launched last year with two models. The founder told Euronews, \"We did it so that we could make a better living and not be dependent on other people who have egos.\" Also last year, the AI-influencer company 1337 emerged from startup stealth mode with $4 million in backing. It has built dozens of AI entities each with niche interests, intricate backstories, and their own Spotify playlists.\nAurora is a 24-year-old climate-crisis activist on a mission to preserve Antarctica. Ezra, a 20-year-old intellectual studying at Oxford, likes hanging out at flea markets and cozy caf\u00e9s. Wai is a 21-year-old abstract artist and sports enthusiast who's opened an art school for young talent.\nJenny Dearing, the company's cofounder and CEO, has been busy selecting content creators who can shape the behaviors of these entities via prompts. Once paired with a person to run things, each AI influencer will create posts and videos and start interacting with its audience. The AI learns from each interaction and uses the data that's gathered to become more engaging. It's no problem for an AI persona to respond to every comment or question it receives, and turn that into instant feedback for whoever is running the show.\nThis model of influencing requires far less time from real people, and it's particularly suited to those who are interested in influencing but don't want to put their own lives up for consumption. \"For us, the long game is enabling more and more creators and brands to come in, create their own entity, manage that entity, advocate for that entity, and evolve and grow them over time,\" Dearing said.\nDoes it matter that an influencer is a human using AI tools or an AI character guided by a human? Either way, they are trying to sell us something. \nFor brands, being able to manage a consistent and engaging social-media presence at a low cost is an attractive pitch \u2014 and some have already expressed interest, Dearing told me. She sees AI influencers being used to provide a deep level of information, support, and guidance on brands and products. \"Product placement is such a tiny potential of the future,\" she said. \"For us, it's really a lot of knowledge exchange.\"\nIt will take time to see whether AI personas catch on, but the initial shift spells trouble for the future of influencing. Dearing doesn't think traditional influencers will disappear, but she thinks a shift toward AI ones is possible. \"I see both scenarios existing for some period of time,\" she said. \"What that balance looks like, who knows?\" She added: \"Over time, maybe it's an 80-20 where brands get really excited about having that control\" and human influencers make up a smaller portion of the budget.\nDo AI influencers really stand a chance at building trust with an audience? Most marketing experts say that what audiences really want on social media is authenticity. How you define that is up for debate, but it's clear that an AI-generated influencer is going to raise some eyebrows. After all, if a computer animation is promoting a new skincare product, you probably wouldn't trust it as much as you would a human influencer swearing it was life-changing. On the flip side, though, anyone who has found themself apologizing to ChatGPT knows exactly how quickly we start to see AI as human.\nA 2020 paper in the Journal of Advertising found that AI influencers \"can produce positive brand benefits similar to those produced by human celebrity endorsers.\" But it also found that when things went wrong with an AI influencer, there was similar reputational brand damage. There's potential for financial harm, too: Earlier this year, an Air Canada AI chatbot gave incorrect information about a discount to a customer. A tribunal ruled that the company was bound by that and had to provide a refund. A study in the European Journal of Marketing found that consumers were just as likely to follow an AI influencer as a human influencer but that they didn't trust the AI influencer as much. They were, however, more likely to talk with others about the AI influencer, which could turn out to be a positive for brands.\nThe trust question may already be moot, though. As AI chatbots have become more commonplace, most of us are already using them regularly. Chatbots are used for healthcare support, for therapy, and to warn teens of the dangers of too much social media \u2014 how different is an AI influencer, really? Was the Air Canada customer wrong to trust the AI bot's information? Clearly, the court didn't think so.\nYou could even argue that there's something more authentic about a brand using an AI entity to market itself and engage with people than a human turning themself into a brand to appeal to the algorithmic robots of a social-media platform. We already know that influencers carefully craft their presentation, often with a manager or coach. Does it matter that an influencer is a human using AI tools or an AI character guided by a human? Either way, they are trying to sell us something.\nThe social-media-management platform Hootsuite's 2024 Social Media Trends report said: \"The most successful brands will redefine 'authenticity.'\" The focus won't be on who is creating the content but on whether the content is compelling. As Dearing sees it, we're moving toward an information-driven experience. \"Ultimately, these influencers become a really lovely visual way to engage on social platforms that are more knowledge-based,\" she said.\nSome experts have a significantly more pessimistic take: Eric Schmidt, a former Google CEO, and Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and author, wrote last year about the potential for \"skillful manipulation of people by AI super-influencers.\" This would be possible, they suggested, by the potential for generative AI to be highly personalized to individual wants, needs, and interests. AI has also been used to create deepfakes of celebrities and influencers that can damage their reputations. Already, there's plenty of interest from marketers in AI's ability to exploit consumer cognitive biases. Essentially providing marketers with a highly targeted, souped-up version of the most effective human influencers.\nIf AI does catch on in the influencer world, Gen Z and Gen Alpha will have an even more challenging time striking influencer gold. What holds value online is already starting to undergo a fundamental shift, and influence will be up for grabs.\nClem De Pressigny is a freelance writer and editor, and was previously the editorial director of i-D magazine.

    "text": "The beauty industry is full of a huge variety of skincare and makeup products. However, certain people need to use special ingredients or blends to achieve their desired results. That\u2019s where Deluvia Skincare and Cosmetics comes in. The company uses ingredients sourced from nature to achieve real results. Learn more about the company in this week\u2019s Small Business Spotlight.\nWhat the Business Does\nOffers skincare and cosmetic products made with quality ingredients.\nFounder Alicia Webb told Small Business Trends, \u201cWe sell a complete line of skincare products enriched with beneficial ingredients such as essential minerals from the Dead Sea, Aloe Vera, Manuka Honey, botanicals, and plant extract.\u201d\nThe company also provides \u201ca loose mineral makeup line that was made from nature, as well as excellent coverage while feeling light and gentle. The line was called \u2018Demure\u2019 from the original word, meaning unassuming, natural-looking makeup.\u201d\nBusiness Niche\nA mix of quality, affordability, and excellent service.\nWebb says, \u201cThroughout Deluvia\u2019s 20+ year existence, the brand has continued to diligently scour the globe for clean, premium ingredients to integrate into our products\u2014ingredients that genuinely deliver results\u2014all offered at down-to-earth prices. We are a family-owned business, established over 20 years ago, and continue to offer excellent customer service (we still answer our phones with a human)!\u201d\nHow the Business Got Started\nDue to a personal struggle.\nWebb spent years searching for solutions for her psoriasis. After years of struggling to find a solution, she came across ingredients that actually worked. Then, she decided to share them with the world.\nShe adds, \u201cTraditional treatments and steroid creams gave short-term relief but resulted in flare-ups. After much research, this led to the Dead Sea and the rich mineral deposits found there.\u201d\nBiggest Win\nReceiving positive feedback from customers.\nWebb says, \u201cWhen we started to get a sincere outpouring of positive feedback from our customers in letters and emails about how much our products have helped them. These continue to keep us motivated to drive the brand forward and be excited to come to work!\u201d\nBiggest Risk\nInvesting in a new business.\nWebb explains, \u201cWe started the business from absolutely nothing. We used every credit card we could get and scraped together the money we needed to buy the skincare raw materials we needed and then we traveled across the country selling at every show and event we could get booked at.\n\u201cUnlike many other companies that start with investment or seed money, we had to go out on a limb because we felt it was the right thing for us to do. There was a lot of sweat and tears back then because we made a blind leap. We were majorly in debt and could have lost everything, including our home.\u201d\nBiggest Challenge\nFacing economic uncertainty.\nWebb adds, \u201cThe economic crash in 2008 was a very rough time for us. We rose above it by hiring over 100 reps and training them to do in-store demonstrations of our products across the U.S.\u201d\nHow They\u2019d Spend an Extra $100,000\nSpreading the word.\nWebb adds, \u201cIt would all go towards promotion to make the product line more known, to get more people to try our products for themselves.\u201d\nTeam Tradition\nRewarding the team based on metrics.\nWebb says, \u201cWe run the business on statistics and we play games and plan trips when certain goals are met. Each week if statistics are uptrending the staff are treated to lunch.\u201d\n*****\nImage: Deluvia, Alicia Webb"

    "text": "Open Wide: 'Skinification' Is Coming For Your Mouth\nA trendy new class of oral care brands are repositioning toothpaste \u2014 an unglamorous necessity \u2014 as skincare, but for your mouth. \nIncreasingly, dental care brands are adopting beauty buzzwords like \u201cprebiotic,\u201d \u201cmicrobiome,\u201d and \u201cpeptides,\u201d terms and ingredients typically applied to skincare products. It\u2019s a phenomenon known as \u201cskinification,\u201d or the application of skincare trends and jargon to non-skincare products. We\u2019ve witnessed the skinification of makeup \u2014 via foundations and concealers infused with skin-loving ingredients like hyaluronic acid and niacinamide \u2014 and hair care, exemplified by hair serums and scalp exfoliators. \nBasically: Skinification is driven by the belief that your entire body deserves to be treated just as diligently as your face. With the skinification of oral care, brushing and flossing twice daily is no longer enough \u2014 consumers are encouraged to optimize their dental routines with fancy-sounding ingredients, \u201ccleaner\u201d alternatives to fluoride, and elevated packaging.\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.\nOn March 19, MOON Oral Beauty (which boasts Kendall Jenner as a \u201cco-creator\u201d) released what it describes as an \u201coral beauty wand.\u201d On one side, the dual-ended pen offers a tooth whitener formulated with lavender oil and honeysuckle leaf extract for \u201csoothing\u201d and\n\u201ccleansing,\u201d respectively \u2014 functions typically associated with skincare products. At the other end is a moisturizing lip treatment, or as MOON puts it, a \u201clip brightener.\u201d \nThe product looks less like something you\u2019d see at a dentist\u2019s office and more like something you\u2019d find at Sephora. The same goes for Theodent, a toothpaste brand that counts Lizzo among its fans. Priced at $100 for a 3.4-ounce tube, Theodent 300 (something like the Rolls Royce of toothpaste) prides itself on using Rennou instead of fluoride. According to Theodent, Rennou \u2014 a patented, organic compound sourced from cacao fruit \u2014 is safer to swallow than fluoride (that said, ingesting small amounts of fluoride is not toxic).\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.\nTheodent isn\u2019t the only dental brand to advertise what it doesn\u2019t contain: OJook, Dr. Brite, and Apa Beauty are all proudly fluoride-free (Ojook also states that its toothpaste is formulated without sulfates, preservatives, and synthetic flavors). With their focus on \u201csafe\u201d ingredients, these new-gen dental care brands seem to be repackaging the clean beauty craze for our mouths.\nBeauty\u2019s newfound focus on the skin microbiome \u2014 an ecosystem of healthy bacteria that helps fight germs and infection \u2014 is also making its mark on oral care. Gallin\u00e9e, a French brand, offers a toothpaste formulated with prebiotics to support the beneficial bacteria colonies in your mouth.\nYour Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Instagram post.\nEven skincare\u2019s embrace of diamonds is infiltrating our brushing routines. Icy Bear Dental Care sells a whitening toothpaste that contains \u201cone carat of finely ground diamond dust.\u201d\nThe skinification of oral care might have you wondering: Do I actually need any of these fancy brushing products? Like a 14-step skincare routine, diamond toothpaste probably isn\u2019t necessary. But it sure looks impressive!"

    "text": "There is a lot of information available online about skincare today, and it can often get overwhelming. We can all agree that experimentation on the skin is not a great idea to begin with. However, having a credible source confirm whether certain skincare DIYs actually work or not can really help us feel confident. \nA recent trend that has caught the attention of internet users is using rice, beetroot powder, and aloe vera to achieve that ultimate glowing skin we all dream of. \nIn a post shared by influencer Anjani Bhoj on Instagram, she talks about mixing these natural kitchen staples to create a soothing mask. \n\u201cHow far would you go to get the glowing skin of your dreams? Well, I would run to my kitchen and not the bathroom. This rice mask is a total game changer if you\u2019re looking for glowing skin (sic),\u201d she captioned the reel, mentioning rice, beetroot powder, and aloe vera as the ingredients used to create it.\nAll three ingredients help in attaining balanced exfoliation, protection from oxidative stress, and optimal hydration, Dr Monica Bambroo, head dermatology and cosmetology at Artemis Hospitals says. (Source: Freepik)\nIndianexpress.com sat in conversation with Dr Monica Bambroo, head dermatology and cosmetology at Artemis Hospitals, to learn more about the benefits of using these ingredients as part of your skincare routine along with ways in which they can be integrated into your daily beauty regimen.\nSkincare benefits of rice, beetroot powder, and aloe vera \nDr Bambroo mentions that all three ingredients perform separate functions for the skin, and when combined, they can help one achieve smooth and glowing skin. According to her the individual skincare benefits of rice, beetroot powder, and aloe vera are as follows: \nRice: These grains are rich in vitamins and minerals, and contain ferulic acid, which helps brighten the skin and reduce dark spots. The gentle exfoliating properties of rice help in getting rid of dead skin cells, giving a smoother complexion and glowing skin.\nBeetroot powder: Enriched with antioxidants like vitamin C and betalains, beetroot powder fights free radicals and reduces signs of ageing, promoting a radiant complexion. Its natural pigments also give a subtle tint, enhancing skin\u2019s natural glow.\nAloe vera: Aloe vera has soothing and hydrating properties, calms inflammation, moisturises the skin, and promotes rapid cell regeneration, giving the skin a healthy, radiant glow.\nHow do the properties of rice, beetroot powder, and aloe vera complement each other? \nWhen it comes to skincare, rice is known for its exfoliating properties that prep the skin, Dr Bambroo suggests, allowing beetroot powder\u2019s antioxidants to penetrate deeply, neutralising free radicals and boosting collagen production. \nShe continues, \u201cAloe vera works by soothing any potential irritation, locking in moisture, and promoting cellular repair. The trio when used together defends against environmental damage, replenishes and rejuvenates.\u201d\nThis powerhouse blend, she says, helps in attaining balanced exfoliation, protection from oxidative stress, and optimal hydration resulting in vibrant, glowing skin that\u2019s nourished from within.\nHow to integrate rice, beetroot powder, and aloe vera into a skincare regimen effectively?\nTo achieve the best results from these ingredients effectively, Dr Bambroo recommends starting with a gentle cleanser containing rice extract to exfoliate and brighten the skin. After this, apply a beetroot powder mask to infuse antioxidants and enhance radiance. \nFor daily hydration and repair, apply an aloe vera gel or cream that has soothing properties, she says, along with creating DIY exfoliating scrubs or masks with rice and beetroot powder, and aloe vera. \nDo not forget to apply sunscreen every day to protect against UV damage. Increase or decrease the frequency of applying the ingredients based on skin sensitivity and observe any reactions. Adjusting usage for a personalised and glowing skincare routine is essential, Dr Bambroo explains."

    "text": "Inspiration meets innovation at Brandweek, the ultimate marketing experience. Join industry luminaries, rising talent and strategic experts in Phoenix, Arizona this September 23\u201326 to assess challenges, develop solutions and create new pathways for growth. Register early to save.\nWhile some A-listers shirk the paparazzi, others accept that the press pack are part and parcel of show business. Some celebrities even stage their own photoshoots, inviting photographers to capture seemingly candid moments and shop them around the tabloids.\nNow, advertisers including Velveeta, CeraVe and Italian luxury brand Bottega Veneta are taking a leaf out of the celebrity paparazzi playbook\u2014blurring the lines between the worlds of marketing and entertainment.\nIn early April, actress Julia Fox debuted hair dye product Velveeta Gold at a New York Knicks game. Naturally, a paparazzo snapped her new look, and a Mail Online article swiftly followed: \u201cJulia Fox covers her Velveeta pin curls with retro scarf while braving NYC\u2019s 45F-degree rainy weather.\u201d\nThe Kraft-owned brand hoped the photos\u2014which captured Fox out in the wild as she\u2019d typically be seen\u2014would generate buzz and cement Velveeta\u2019s status as a lifestyle brand (something it\u2019s been working on with agency Johannes Leonardo over the past couple of years).\nImmediate results showed that the plan worked. On the launch day, the stunt scored a social sentiment of 51.3% positive and 47.6% neutral, Velveeta brand manager Stephanie Vance told ADWEEK. To date, it\u2019s clocked over 1 billion earned media impressions.\n\u201cInstead of showing up in spaces we know Julia is expected to be seen in, we wanted her to make an appearance and hijack a place that she wouldn\u2019t typically visit,\u201d Vance explained.\nAnd so, the brand put her courtside at a National Basketball Association game, a place that \u201caligned\u201d with its target audiences\u2019 interests, said Vance, adding, \u201cJulia was able to grab attention and get people talking.\u201d\nAhead of its Super Bowl 58 spot, CeraVe also whipped the internet into a frenzy with pap shots that showed actor Michael Cera carrying bags filled with bottles of its moisturizer.\nCeraVe relied on the internet gossip engine to build buzz without explaining anything. As the photos went viral and fueled online conspiracies that Cera was a skincare mogul, the stunts garnered press coverage from the likes of Page Six, People, The Cut, Us Weekly and Mail Online.\n\u201cWe phased out the storytelling,\u201d said Adam Kornblum, senior vice president and head of global digital marketing for CeraVe, at the time, revealing that in the days after the Big Game, CeraVe garnered 18 billion earned media impressions and 10 billion social media impressions with help from creative shop Ogilvy. \nContent that hacks culture\nFor celebrity publicists, this isn\u2019t a new practice. In the dawn of social-first media, it\u2019s a powerful tool.\nStars have long enlisted photographers to take candid snaps of their vacation or trip to the store, usually in the name of controlling a narrative or endorsing a product. \nSee: Singer Grimes reading a copy of The Communist Manifesto on the sidewalk after separating from Elon Musk, or the dozens of images of Dunkin\u2019 ambassador Ben Affleck carrying an iced coffee. In the case of the latter, the coffee chain even referenced some of these images in its Super Bowl 57 ad.\nReality TV stars Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag have admitted to setting up pap shots, while paparazzo and creator of Stupid Famous People Justin Steffman told Cosmopolitan many setup photos include a paid-for element \u201cwhere a photo agency works as a middleman between a celebrity and a company who has a product to sell.\u201d\nThe spring 2024 campaign from Italian design house Bottega Veneta flipped this narrative on its head. First, it dressed artist A$AP Rocky and model Kendall Jenner head to toe in its clothes, then it sent them to go about their daily lives. The resulting paparazzi photos were lifted straight for the wires, and Bottega put its logo over the top of shots from Getty Images and Backgrid.\nThe resulting campaign was both meta and chic. Tom Garland, co-founder of brand consultancy Edition+Partners, said the brand was speaking the language of its customers. Other brands, including Gucci, quickly emulated the deliberate paparazzi feel of the creative.\n\u201cThis was content that hacked culture and made us look at the same image twice. That\u2019s a powerful thing,\u201d he added, although he cautioned that this trend could become \u201ctired quick\u201d if brands rinse and repeat it. \nFor Garland\u2019s co-founder, Christopher Morency, despite the significant expansion of platforms and touchpoints used by brands post-pandemic, prevailing tactics, formats and sales approaches in traditional brand building remain largely repetitive.\n\u201cThe best brands, however, set themselves apart by redefining narrative strategies, seamlessly integrating conversion into the brand story, and by blurring the traditional lines that once separated inspiration and sales,\u201d he added.\nBeyond engagement, this is a strategy that could help drive brands\u2019 bottom lines. Taylor Swift\u2019s recent Bahamas holiday with footballer Travis Kelce, which was captured through a long lens, shows the potential for pap shots to drive sales.\nAnalysis of Google Trends data reveals that searches for \u201cThe Bahamas\u201d increased by 351% since pictures of the duo\u2019s holiday were published. Additionally, there was a surge of 770% in searches for \u201cyellow bikini\u201d following the release of a paparazzi image featuring Swift wearing one on the beach.\nSpeaking on the findings, Marc Porcar, CEO of ecommerce platform QRFY, said these numbers underscored the enduring allure of celebrity and its profound impact on fan engagement. \n\u201cThis symbiotic relationship between celebrities and their audience reflects the power of cultural icons in shaping societal trends and consumer choices and truly highlights their influencer power,\u201d he added. \nMaybe brands shouldn\u2019t remove tabloid photographers from their favorite contacts quite yet. \nEnjoying Adweek's Content?

Changing consumer preferences and advancing technologies continually reshape its landscape.

    "text": "Photo by Rosdiana Ciaravolo/Getty Images\nGetty Images \nThe lips have always been one of the most popular treatment areas thanks to their ability to balance and harmonize the face, but emphasis on the area has reached new heights in 2024. \"The lips have become a focus that goes beyond the aesthetic and almost hinders on a cultural movement,\" Physician Associate Cheyanne, CEO and Founder of The Private Suite LA, tells me. Double board-certified facial plastic surgeon and top celebrity injector Jason B. Diamond confirms that requests for lip augmentation have increased over the last decade, with younger and younger patients seeking lip filler in recent years.\nAesthetic practitioners' repertoires of treatments have now broadened immensely to include regenerative medicine, lasers, new injectables and \"smart\" active ingredients. The offerings are so expansive that double board-certified plastic surgeon Ben Talei launched a lip-specific clinic, Cupid Lips, in Beverly Hills in February 2024. \"There is so much to do for the lips that a focused and dedicated lip center was necessary to give patients all the essential treatments available for the mouth [area],\" says Dr. Talei, who is known for the natural-looking results of his surgical Modified Upper Lip Lift technique, which he dubs the Cupid Lift.\nThe desired lip aesthetic is still fuller and more-defined, yet subtle enough to be believable. \"Patients do want lip enhancement more than ever, but don't want the overly-filled look as much,\" confirms board-certified plastic surgeon Marc Mani of Beverly Hills, CA. Keep reading to learn more about the top lip trends for achieving a natural-looking aesthetic in 2024.\nThe Cupid Lift by Dr. Ben Talei\nCupid Lips and the Beverly Hills Center for Plastic Surgery \nIn-Clinic Lip Offerings\nThe American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS) notes that patients are seeking \"longer-lasting\" and more \"natural-looking\" procedures in-office. Board-certified plastic surgeon Jason Roostaeian has seen an uptick in consultations for surgical lip lifts, which permanently shorten the space between the nose and upper lip (i.e., the philtrum) to expose more of the lip's pink, mucosal underside. The procedure has been around for fifty years, but the AAFPRS confirms its upward trend in the last several years. Dr. Talei adds that younger patients also seek it out as a standalone procedure as opposed to being an adjunctive surgery during a facelift.\nRegenerative medicine is also influencing lip aesthetics. Dr. Talei and Dr. Mani use patient-derived, regenerative nanofat to rejuvenate, hydrate and plump their patients' lips from within. Nanofat is derived from a small, purified sample of the patient's fat, removing any volumizing fibers but leaving behind the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) containing regenerative stem cells, growth factors, exosomes and more. Dr. Mani uses anti-aging, skin-enhancing nanofat for the face and lips in his signature MIST technique, while Dr. Talei combines nanofat with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in what is known as platelet-hybridized adipose therapy (PHAT)\u2014or PHAT Lips\u2014for results that last for over a year.\nThe AAFPRS notes that filler fatigue is a real phenomenon, but is popular when natural-looking and in the right injector's hands. Dr. Diamond's clients, many of whom are celebrities, seek results that augment the lips while respecting its natural shape. Medical Esthetician Amy Peterson, founder of Skincare by Amy Peterson in Miami, Florida, is also a fan of using the low-density hyaluronic filler Skinvive\u2014which became FDA-approved in the U.S. in May 2023\u2014to create a more diffusely hydrated appearance in the lips.\nAside from injectables, Peterson offers a heat-based treatment called Liplase at her clinic, with a series of six treatments enhancing the size and shape of the lips. \"Liplase heats the deep layers of the inner and external lips to create fuller, smoother lips and to augment their size and shape without injections,\" she explains.\nANFISA An-Gloss Ceramide Lip Treatment\nANFISA SKIN \nLip-Care Regimens\nLip care has also become a substantiated step in the skin care regimen. Board-certified osteopathic dermatologist Leela Athalye points out TikTok's viral \"lip basting\" hack for treating the lips with chemical exfoliation (think: low concentrations of glycolic or lactic acids) followed by a thick, highly-emollient balms or moisturizers. Board-certified plastic surgeon Konstantin Vasyukevich noticed over 5.5 million TikTok views of videos DIY-ing lip care by combining hyaluronic acid and peptide face serums with occlusive balms like Aquaphor.\nSkin care-grade lip masks for plumping hydration are also becoming more common. Occlusive waxes or oils are being combined with plumping and collagen-enhancing peptides (i.e., Maxilip, Volulip, etc.), along with barrier-reparative skincare ingredients like ceramides. As evidence, the cult-favorite indie brand ANFISA launched AN-GLOSS Ceramide Lip Treatment, $45, in 2024 to rave reviews. Founder Aly Korchemniy tested over 350 lab samples before finalizing a formula of containing \"VoluLip and MaxiLip, vegan cholesterol, five bio-identical ceramides (ceramide EOP, ceramide NP, ceramide NS, ceramide AS, and ceramide AP), five cold-pressed oils, and soothing Allantoin and Bisbalool.\"\nWith beauty devices on the rise, you can even shop for lip-specific red light therapy devices, like the CurrentBody Lip Perfector, $189, not to mention lip sheet masks, such as KNESKO Amethyst Hydrate Lip Mask, $17.\nLip trends in 2024\ngetty \nLip Trends In Cosmetics\nIn makeup, get ready for less-drying, natural finishes and softer-matte textures, like the hydrating Madame Gabriela line or the new launches by Prada Beauty. There will also be plenty of lips coated in slick glosses, like the new Armani Beauty Prisma Gloss collection, in 2024.\nCelebrity makeup artist Jamie Greenberg says \"metallics and wet-textured glosses with corals, peaches, and pastel hues are coming in hot,\" while celebrity makeup artist Nadia Hoecklin adds that 90s-inspired chocolate hues and dark brown liners are also in. As for technique, makeup artist Diane Caranica noticed \"poetic lips\" on the runway, referencing a blurred edge that hints at a freshly-kissed look. This aesthetic is sometimes achieved with blush (but not to be confused with the \"lip blushing\" trend, which tints the lips with a semi-permanent tattoo).\nOne thing is certain: the lips remain a central focus in beauty. Whether one of the above trends overtakes the others remains to be seen, but there will be no shortage of inspiration (or options!) when it comes to lip augmentation, treatments, or care in 2024."

    "text": "How AI And AR Are Enhancing The Beauty Space\ngetty \nThe beauty industry has witnessed a remarkable transformation in recent years, partially due to the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies. These groundbreaking innovations have not only changed how consumers interact with beauty products but have also revolutionized the way brands market and sell their offerings.\n93% of users on Snapchat have already shown interest in using AR for shopping. From virtual try-on experiences to personalized skincare recommendations, AI and AR have opened up a world of possibilities, enhancing the beauty space in unprecedented ways.\nVirtual Try-Ons\nOne of the most significant advancements facilitated by AI and AR in the beauty industry is the virtual try-on experience. With the emergence of AI-powered virtual try-on tools, shoppers can now experiment with various cosmetics without even having to visit a store location. Whether it's lipstick shades, eyeshadows, or foundation, shoppers can see how they look without physically applying anything, allowing them to see how different shades and styles look on their skin before buying.\n\u201cTraditionally, consumers would visit brick-and-mortar stores to test different makeup products before making a purchase. However, with the advent of AR-powered virtual try-on tools, shoppers can now experiment with various cosmetics from the comfort of their homes,\u201d says Wayne Liu, a founding member of Perfect, a company developing AI and AR tech for the beauty and fashion industry. \u201cVirtual try-ons empower customers to express their creativity and experiment with new beauty trends, fostering a sense of empowerment and self-confidence.\u201d\nShade Matching\nAnyone who has attempted to buy foundation knows that finding the right foundation shade can be challenging. AI helps by matching skin tones accurately. By analyzing factors such as skin tone, texture, and lighting conditions, AI algorithms can ensure that virtual makeup seamlessly blends with the user's natural features, providing a more authentic representation of the final look.\n\u201cBy harnessing the power of AI, beauty brands can offer an inclusive range of shades that cater to diverse skin tones, empowering customers to find their ideal match,\u201d says Liu. This can make it simpler to match the right foundation the first time.\nSkincare Analysis\nIn addition to virtual try-on experiences, AI-driven beauty platforms are revolutionizing skincare routines by analyzing users' skin conditions and providing personalized product recommendations tailored to their specific needs. By analyzing skin type, concerns, and environmental factors, AI algorithms can identify the most suitable skincare products and routines for each individual, helping them achieve optimal results.\nIn addition, AI-powered skincare platforms can track users' progress over time, allowing for continuous refinement and optimization of their routines. \u201cBy analyzing data on factors such as skin type, beauty goals, skin health improvements, and product efficacy, brands can recommend personalized products, curate content, and offer targeted promotions to deliver even better results,\u201d explains Liu. This personalized approach to skincare enhances the effectiveness of beauty products and fosters stronger brand loyalty among consumers. \"It allows beauty companies to personalize their recommendations to the nth degree more than they can do currently,\" says Toto Haba, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for Benefit Cosmetics.\nMulti-Channel Communication\nBeyond virtual try-on experiences and skincare recommendations, AI and AR technologies are also reshaping how beauty brands engage with consumers. Social media platforms and mobile apps equipped with AR filters allow users to experiment with different makeup looks and share their creations with friends and followers.\nThese interactive experiences drive user engagement and serve as powerful marketing tools for beauty brands, allowing them to showcase their products in a fun and engaging way. In fact, 50% of consumers prefer AI-powered recommendations for beauty products. And it is predicted that more than 70% of beauty brands will be using AI for product development in 2025, according to a Gartner survey.\nThe fusion of AI and AR technologies is revolutionizing the beauty industry, offering innovative solutions to improve the customer experience. From virtual try-on experiences and personalized skincare recommendations to interactive social media filters and AI-powered virtual assistants, these advancements are reshaping how beauty products are marketed, sold, and experienced by consumers worldwide."

    "text": "Therabody makes a slew of devices that aid in wellness and recovery. \nGoogle Images \n\u201cWe recognize the growing emphasis on self-care and want to ensure accessibility.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Therabody vice president of science and innovation, Tim Roberts, recently said to me about the company\u2019s ethos in a recent interview. Therabody makes devices designed to aid people in wellness and other areas of personal health such as recovery and skincare. The products integrate with the company\u2019s eponymous Therabody app, available on iOS and Android. Therabody\u2019s flagship product is the Theragun, a percussive massage gun invented in 2008 by Dr. Jason Wersland. Roberts has been with Therabody since 2019, joining the team from the Gatorade Sports Science Institute, where he worked with some of the world\u2019s best athletes and conducted scientific research.\n\u201cAt the core of Therabody\u2019s mission is to help everybody who wants to live better, longer, healthier lives\u2014whether that be athletes, fitness enthusiasts, parents, grandparents who want to play with their grandkids, frontline workers like nurses and delivery drivers who are constantly on their feet and people who work in front of a screen,\u201d Roberts said of Therabody\u2019s raison d'\u00eatre in the industry. \u201cAll of these have unique needs, however, these can really be understood as overarching categories\u2014treating pain and discomfort, relieving tension and increasing relaxation, reducing stress, optimizing performance and recovery, supporting sleep, and improving skin health.\u201d\nRoberts described Therabody as being a \u201cpioneer\u201d in wellness technology and noted the company is \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the trends and changes happening in the fitness and wellness industry. Last year, the company introduced three new Theragun devices, the Pro Plus, the Sense, and the Relief, alongside a corresponding marketing campaign called \u201cFor The Workout Called Life.\u201d According to Roberts, the company\u2019s technology plus the campaign\u2019s focus on what he termed \u201ceveryday benefits to people\u2019s physical and mental health.\u201d He added one device helps a person with relaxation through breath work, while another provides one-touch percussive massage therapy. All told, the products \u201chave helped anchor us in our goal to be more accessible.\u201d\nTechnology, Roberts told me, plays \u201can increasingly important role\u201d in delivering personal health and wellness. Everything from wearable devices to meditation apps and more is enabling greater access to what he characterized as \u201cthe ability to monitor, understand, and improve their physical and mental health.\u201d Indeed, wearables like those from Therabody or even an Apple Watch have increasing popularity in large part because of the health-tracking functionality. This can be of immense benefit to those in the disability community. Many cope with chronic conditions such as diabetes or arthritis, for example, that takes a lot of mental energy to monitor on a daily basis in addition to the physical challenges they impose. It\u2019s highly plausible that a massager or other device from, say, Therabody could very well soothe a person both ways: emotionally and physically. As I often say, accessibility and assistive technology is a dynamo and takes many different forms; what Roberts and Therabody does for people is yet another great example of it.\n\u201cNot only is the outcome of our product development, wellness technology, but technology plays a pivotal role in the development process itself,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cOur engineering and science teams have access to different technologies to prototype and validate within our lab\u2014this rigorous validation can be of the product specifications and of the desired physiological and neuromuscular responses. Technology also plays a key role in our consumer research and understanding the needs and preferences of different key audiences.\u201d\nWhen asked about the reception towards Therabody\u2019s work, Roberts said feedback has been \u201creally great.\u201d He said the support from both academic research and research partners \u201creeinforces that our approach to science supporting our claims, optimizing our products, and connecting with the consumer is doing well.\u201d Roberts added Therabody feels privileged to work with some renowned experts, noting the use of the \u201ccorrect strategic approach for science in the industry becomes increasingly important\u201d will help distinguish companies from the competition in the health and wellness space. Therabody is one of them.\n\u201cFeedback of any kind serves as \u2018data\u2019 for us that we can use as part of our internal scientific methods,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThe feedback we get from the users of our products\u2014whether this is the best athletes in the world, student-athletes, the parent or grandparent, or anyone\u2014is hugely valuable and we continue to optimize how we take this information into our business and leverage it.\u201d\nLooking towards the future, Roberts said the evolution of science and technology over the past half-century has changed how people think about health and wellness. Roberts believes the future of medicine, particularly around musculoskeletal healthcare, will involve self-administered independent treatments. In addition, Roberts noted the groundwork laid by Therabody in terms of leveraging technology in optimizing performance and recovery has had a \u201cforever changed\u201d effect.\n\u201cWe are moving into an era of science-led innovation where our organization will continue to lead the way in developing and promoting accessible wellness solutions for individuals amidst their busy lifestyles,\u201d Roberts said of the outlook for Therabody. \u201cOur commitment to science and new partnerships with like-minded individuals and organizations is just the beginning of our efforts to ensure we continue to use our innovation to change the industry for the better.\u201d"

    "text": "Founder and CEO, Subkit.\ngetty \nThe unique stories and personal experiences of founders are not just the soul of their brands but a strategic advantage. This kind of authenticity is significant at a time when consumers seek connection, not just products.\nAs a founder myself, I've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of weaving personal narratives into the fabric of a brand. This approach can not only set your offering apart but resonate deeply with your audience, fostering loyalty and community.\nFounders should embrace their journeys. They should leverage their distinct experiences to inform product development, brand ethos and market positioning. In doing so, they can unlock engagement and authenticity. This helps turn their personal vision into a collective experience shared with their customers.\nTo help guide you on this journey, let's take a closer look at how the founders of six distinct companies, each with a unique narrative, translated their personal passion into products that resonate deeply with consumers.\nIQBAR: Lead With A Personal Need\nIQBAR started with founder Will Nitze's personal quest to solve his own cognitive fog and nutritional needs. Frustrated by the lack of snack options catering to brain health, Nitze delved into neuroscience research, ultimately crafting a snack bar formulated to support cognitive function. His personal journey underscores the core belief of IQBAR: That nutrition should nourish both the body and the mind.\nILIA Beauty: Search For A Cleaner Alternative\nILIA Beauty's founder, Sasha Plavsic, is driven by a desire to redefine beauty standards through clean, safe and potent formulas. Her journey began with a critical look at the ingredients in her lip balm. She was shocked by many of the ingredients, and this led to a broader exploration of the impact of cosmetics on health. ILIA Beauty now stands as a pioneer in the clean beauty movement.\nMUD\\WTR: Tap Into The Personal Wellness Trend\nShane Heath\u2019s creation of MUD\\WTR, a mushroom-based alternative to coffee, was motivated by his personal experience with the negative effects of excessive caffeine consumption. He sought a healthier alternative that still embraced the ritual of coffee and also shared the growing consumer interest in wellness and mindfulness. He was able to position MUD\\WTR as a brand that\u2019s not just about what\u2019s in the cup but also the lifestyle and awareness it promotes.\nSolawave: Make Technology More Accessible\nSolawave's journey began when its founder, Andrew Silberstein, recognized the transformative effects of red light therapy and microcurrents on his own skin health. His personal experience with these technologies fueled the creation of a portable, at-home device that combined skincare therapies. This innovation helped democratize access to advanced skincare. It also embodies the founder\u2019s belief in self-care and the power of technology to enhance well-being.\nCamille Rose: Care For Others\nJanell Stephens, the founder of Camille Rose, was propelled by a personal mission to create natural, safe products for her family. She wanted to address the lack of options for her children\u2019s sensitive skin and hair. Her kitchen experiments, rooted in a holistic approach to wellness, evolved into a line of hair care products. Stephens\u2019 story is a powerful narrative of maternal love transforming into a business that champions natural, effective solutions for a diverse community.\nAgent Nateur: Champion Health Advocacy\nJena Covello founded Agent Nateur to address her health issues, notably endometriosis, by creating a natural, aluminum-free deodorant. Her commitment to holistic wellness, as well as clean, non-GMO ingredients, shaped Agent Nateur's ethos. Starting from her kitchen with a deodorant stick, Covello grew her brand into a comprehensive skincare line. Agent Nateur's evolution from a personal solution to a successful brand illustrates the impact of founder-driven stories in challenging industry standards.\nThe Impact Of Founder-Led Inspiration\nThese stories highlight a common thread: products and brands shaped by the founders' own needs, discoveries and convictions tend to resonate more profoundly with consumers. This connection goes beyond mere transactions to foster communities of users who share the founders' values and aspirations.\nThe success of these brands also showcases the power of personal inspiration in product development and how individual journeys can lead to innovations that fill gaps in the market. This is important because the market is crowded with generic products and fleeting trends. These founder-led brands stand out for their authenticity and commitment to their original vision. Their stories remind aspiring entrepreneurs that true innovation often starts with a personal quest or challenge. By staying true to your roots and leveraging your unique perspective, you can create products that not only succeed commercially but also make a meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives.\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

    "text": "Founder and CEO, Subkit / Collabs.io.\ngetty \nInnovation thrives on the edge of comfort zones. Businesses that question the usual way of doing things redefine what's possible. They stand out. Because they dare to challenge the norms we've all grown accustomed to. This is bravery. It captures attention, sparks change and drives progress.\nWhy does this matter? Because authenticity and innovation set brands apart. They offer something unique in a sea of sameness. These brands offer new perspectives, solve old problems in new ways and invite consumers to think differently.\nI should know because my previous company challenged norms in the concert industry by introducing the world\u2019s first concert subscription model where everyone else was selling tickets. This helped us stand out in an ocean of ticketing companies and carve a space for ourselves.\nLet's explore four more pioneers who stepped beyond traditional boundaries to carve out a niche. They have influenced the broader industry landscape. Through their stories, we'll see how challenging the norm is, a mindset that can lead to breakthroughs, growth and a loyal following. By embracing this approach, brands can redefine their industries and create lasting impact.\nPeach & Lily: Pioneering Beauty Curators\nPeach & Lily have their own product line, but they also bring hidden beauty gems from Korea to a global audience. This is not following trends. It's discovery. They simply go hunting. By digging deep to find products with a cult following, they've introduced a new beauty standard. It's not the usual marketing-driven selection. It's curated with care, prioritizing what genuinely works and resonates with consumers.\nTheir process is rigorous. Every product must pass through a stringent quality check. Ingredients matter. Formulations matter. Peach & Lily ensures that everything they offer is not only effective but also safe and respectful to the skin. This approach challenges the beauty industry's norm of pushing products based on hype. Instead, they've built a reputation on trust and effectiveness.\nThe result? A brand that stands as a beacon for those seeking real solutions. Peach & Lily exemplify how being selective and authentic can redefine an industry's standards and deeply connect with consumers.\nFur: Advocates For Body Positivity\nFur took a stand in an industry that was shy about discussing body hair. They chose honesty over convenience, keeping \"pubic\" on their products despite significant pushback. This wasn't just about word choice. It was about integrity and sparking a conversation on body positivity.\nRejecting a lucrative retail opportunity meant risking short-term growth. Yet, Fur understood that true value lies in staying true to their mission. They've become more than a brand; they're a movement advocating for openness and self-acceptance.\nThis bold move paid off. Their commitment to authenticity garnered a loyal customer base and set a new precedent for personal care. Fur's journey demonstrates that challenging norms can lead to meaningful change and solidify a brand's place in the market.\nBragg Foods: Tackling The Taste Barrier With Innovation\nBragg Foods recognized a universal truth that many have learned to grimace through: Apple cider vinegar (ACV) doesn't win any awards for its taste. Yet, its health benefits are too significant to ignore. Faced with this challenge, Bragg saw an opportunity to innovate. Enter their groundbreaking ACV supplements.\nThese capsules deliver all the health perks of ACV without the sour face. It's a simple yet revolutionary idea: Why not make wellness palatable? By concentrating the essence of ACV into a tasteless, easy-to-consume form, Bragg has removed one of the biggest barriers to ACV's widespread adoption.\nThis move is about convenience and inclusivity. Bragg's approach to overcoming the taste barrier expands its market reach and sets a new standard in the wellness industry for thoughtful, consumer-centric innovation. In doing so, Bragg Foods challenges the norm that health and palatability can't go hand in hand, making wellness accessible and enjoyable for all.\nBubble Skincare: Affordable Innovation For Gen-Z\nShai Eisenman, the visionary behind Bubble Skincare, noticed that, despite the advanced nature of young consumers, their skincare choices remained tethered to brands and products that hadn't evolved for generations.\nWhat sets Bubble apart is its commitment to affordability. Strategically designing their product sizes ensures every item stays under the $20 mark and aligns with the financial realities of its target audience. This approach challenges the norm by offering high-quality, effective skincare solutions within a budget-friendly range.\nBubble's expansion into major retailers like Walmart, CVS and Ulta proves that you don't have to break the bank to provide or receive top-notch skincare. This bold move underlines a crucial shift towards making premium skincare not a luxury but a standard accessible to everyone. It also helps reshape how the industry views price, quality and consumer accessibility.\nConclusion\nThese companies share a common thread: the courage to challenge industry norms. Their success stories highlight the power of innovation and staying true to core values. These brands invite everyone to play by new rules.\nTheir journeys remind us that breaking the mold is about more than just being different. It's about leading with purpose and daring to offer something better.\nThis mindset paves the way for a more thoughtful, inclusive and innovative industry landscape. As these brands continue to inspire and challenge norms, they redefine what it means to lead in their sectors. This shows us that the most significant breakthroughs often come from thinking outside the box.\nTo shake things up in your industry, first, stay curious. Ask the big \"What if?\" and \"Why not?\" These questions push you past the usual into innovation. Next, embrace your unique voice. Authenticity isn't just a buzzword; it's your brand's signature. It's what makes you, you. Let it shine in everything you do. Lastly, remember that bravery is key. Stepping out of the comfort zone is scary but needed. It's where growth happens.\nHere's a simple blueprint: Get curious. Be real. Dare to jump. Each of these steps is about making a difference. They are how you leave a mark.\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?"

    "text": "Chiranjiv spearheads AI/ML solutions for diverse industries at Course5 Intelligence.\ngetty \nAs someone who's navigated the crossroads of technology and marketing for over two decades, I've witnessed firsthand the seismic shifts in how brands connect with their audiences. My unique vantage point comes from not just observing but actively engaging with the evolution of influencer marketing\u2014from its humble beginnings to the dawn of Influencer Marketing 3.0.\nThis journey has not only shaped my understanding of digital landscapes but also honed my ability to foresee and leverage emerging trends. Today, I want to share insights from this journey, particularly how the integration of technologies like large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), machine learning and artificial intelligence copilots are redefining the essence of influencer marketing.\nThe Impact Of Micro- And Nano-Influencers\nOur team's early experiments with AI in influencer marketing revealed a fascinating trend: the undeniable impact of micro- and nano-influencers. For example, I worked with a small skincare brand that leveraged AI to sift through data and identify niche influencers. This strategy, rooted in genuine connections and relatable content, skyrocketed their engagement rates. It was a clear testament to the power of authenticity in the digital age, something that massive follower counts couldn't compete with.\nThe transition from theoretical AI applications to tangible, impactful marketing strategies has been transformative, particularly with advancements like ChatGPT. My experience with LLMs and copilots in refining marketing approaches, especially in optimizing influencer marketing ROI, has been enlightening. A standout moment involved leveraging these AI tools for a fashion brand. Their capacity to sift through vast datasets and distill personalized marketing insights significantly influenced the campaign's direction.\nWhile AI's prowess in content creation, especially video, introduces a new era of personalized engagement, we're still navigating its full spectrum of capabilities. The path to flawless, AI-generated content that adeptly handles intricate prompts continues. Despite occasional missteps, such as AI's imaginative yet inaccurate image creations, these instances merely underscore the ongoing journey to harness AI's full potential in revolutionizing how we conceive and execute content strategies.\nEmbracing AI's Imperfections\nThe path to Influencer Marketing 3.0 is paved with innovation, learning and a fair share of AI-induced quirks. My experience has taught me that embracing these imperfections is part of the journey. Each misstep offers invaluable insights into how you can better integrate AI into your marketing strategies, making them more authentic, engaging and impactful.\nHaving said all of this, let\u2019s see how this can actually work.\nFor a leading snacks and beverages company that I worked with, the integration of ML, LLMs, RAG and AI copilots into the development of an influencer analytics model represented a cutting-edge approach to influencer marketing. This comprehensive strategy, spanning pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight stages, leveraged advanced technologies to enhance engagement, refine marketing strategies and foster meaningful connections with consumers at all stages of the campaign. Here\u2019s how the journey unfolded.\nBefore The Campaign: Model Development\nLearning From The Past: Initially, our team utilized ML to aggregate and pre-process a diverse set of data, including social media interactions, influencer engagement metrics and consumer feedback on snack and beverage products. This phase ensured the data was clean, normalized and ready for deeper analysis.\nBy employing LLMs, we advanced our feature engineering process, extracting nuanced insights from textual data such as sentiment toward the products and thematic trends within the snacks and beverages sector. This allowed us to identify features crucial for predicting influencer success, including engagement rates, engagement value and content authenticity.\nModel Selection And Training With RAG: Experimentation with various ML models was enhanced by RAG, enabling our team to dynamically incorporate the latest research and trends into the model training process. This approach ensured our models were not only robust but also highly attuned to the evolving landscape of influencer marketing.\nModel Evaluation: Our models were rigorously evaluated using precise metrics. The integration of an AI copilot facilitated an in-depth analysis, enabling us to understand the driving forces behind influencer performance and fine-tune our selection criteria.\nActive Campaign Phase: Dynamic Deployment And Real-Time Optimization\nModel Deployment And Performance Monitoring: Deploying our ML model into the live environment marked the beginning of the in-flight phase. Real-time monitoring, powered by LLM and copilot, allowed us to track performance and swiftly identify any deviations from expected outcomes, ensuring our influencer collaborations were continually optimized.\nModel Updating With RAG: Regular updates to the model, informed by RAG\u2019s ability to fetch and integrate real-time data and trends, kept our strategies aligned with consumer preferences and market dynamics, ensuring ongoing relevance and effectiveness.\nPost-Campaign Strategy Refinement And Evolution: Generating Insights With Explainability\nAnalysis With LLM And Copilot: Post-campaign, LLM and copilot were instrumental in analyzing performance data, offering deep insights into what strategies worked best and why. This analysis was crucial for understanding consumer engagement and preference patterns.\nRecommendations And Reporting: Based on these insights, we developed targeted recommendations for future campaigns, focusing on enhancing influencer selection, engagement tactics and content relevance. Detailed reports and dashboards, enriched with LLM-generated insights, highlighted the impact of our influencer marketing efforts, showcasing successes and areas for improvement.\nThe Future Of AI In Marketing\nThe synergy between ML, LLM, RAG and AI copilots can not only propel your influencer marketing strategies forward but also ensure they remain adaptable and aligned with the fast-paced nature of your industry. Let's keep in mind that technology advances rapidly every day. By the time you're reading this, some things may have already been replaced. However, it's essential to embrace change and experimentation as the key to staying ahead.\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

    "text": "As many people who have swiped right can tell you, it\u2019s one thing to view a profile online, quite another to spend time with someone In Real Life. So, last week over 30 major buyers and distributors from China and Southeast (SE) Asia descended on Sydney to press the flesh and test the credentials of Australian brand owners keen to win hearts and dollars in the Asian region.\nThe \u201cBusiness Matching\u201d (essentially, speed dating) event was just one component of the 6th Alibaba E-Commerce Expo, held in Sydney for the first time since late 2019, pre-COVID.\nThe show floor at the Alibaba E-Commerce Expo in Sydney, Australia \nJon Bird \nAs Alibaba\u2019s Head of Marketing for Australia and New Zealand (NZ), Kit Yau, told me, the aim of the Expo is \u201cto bring merchants, brands and stakeholders within the e-commerce ecosystem together\u201d, and learn about the latest trends in online selling. Exhibitors - dominated by health, beauty, food and beverage categories - also received Asian market briefings and could attend an associated conference.\nAustralia, with its relatively small population of 27 million, may seem an odd place for e-commerce giant Alibaba to stage a major expo. But Australia is on the doorstep of Asia, and punches way above its weight on Alibaba\u2019s various platforms.\nDuring 11.11 (Singles\u2019 Day) , the world\u2019s biggest shopping festival, Aussie brands are regularly amongst the top 10 countries featured on Alibaba. In 2022, there were 2,700 Australian brands listed on Alibaba alone, and discount drugstore chain Chemist Warehouse is the number one cross-border retailer on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall global site. (Last year, Chemist Warehouse was crowned International E-Tailer of the Year - China. For more on Chemist Warehouse, I wrote an article in Forbes late last year.)\nDiscount drugstore Chemist Warehouse at the Alibaba E-Commerce Expo\nJon Bird \nYau says that Aussie and NZ brands are prized by Asian consumers for their perceived \u201cnatural, green\u201d credentials and high quality, particularly in the health and wellness space. From a brand perspective, the opportunities are massive, not just in China, which is the world\u2019s second largest consumer market, but also in SE Asia, which is home to 661 million people, double the population of the United States. Alibaba-owned Lazada, SE Asia\u2019s #2 online marketplace behind Shopee, is proving to be a powerful distribution channel for Aussie brands.\nSupplement and skincare company, EZZ, is riding high on Asia\u2019s health and wellness boom. Corporate Affairs Director James Hudson told me that 80% of EZZ products are exported to China and a number of SE Asian markets, including Vietnam and Singapore. One of the big challenges for Australian brands, according to Hudson, is learning how to sell online in a way that appeals to Asian consumers, who are amongst the most digitally sophisticated in the world. A key part of EZZ\u2019s strategy is using influencers and live streaming.\n\u201cAustralian and even US brands don\u2019t understand live streaming commerce at all,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cI talk to my friends and they\u2019ve never bought anything off a live stream.\u201d In Asia, live streaming commerce (think QVC for the digital age) is not just a way of shopping, it\u2019s a way of life. To demonstrate the power of live streaming, EZZ brought leading influencer Liu Yuanyuan to Australia for the Expo.\nInfluencer Liu Yuanyuan and EZZ's James Hudson live stream at the Alibaba E-Commerce Expo\nJames Hudson \nWith 20 million followers, Li Yuanyuan instantly attracted 40,o00 viewers to the live stream from Australia. Hudson marvelled at Yuanyuan\u2019s professionalism and energy. \u201cShe brings with her a whole team including hair and makeup. Yuanyuan did this live stream for 8 hours straight, and every minute she was selling, saying \u2018buy this, here\u2019s the discount\u2019.\u201d Live stream hosts typically work on commission, plus a fee, with travel costs (if required) on top.\nAsian consumers \u201care being marketed to all the time...they are very savvy...and their expectations are high,\u201d added Hudson. So shoppers demand not just a deal, but \u201cdoing it in an entertaining way, where it\u2019s fun and interesting\u201d. That requires \u201ca lot of gamification\u201d, Hudson said, which could include collecting items online in order to gain a coupon or incentive to buy. The general trend towards what I would call \u201cCreative Commerce\u201d, prevalent in the East, is also beginning to trend in Western markets.\nAlibaba Group\u2019s mission is \u201cto make it easy to do business anywhere\u201d. So, another element of the Expo was to highlight AliExpress Business, a new business model from Alibaba which helps companies with an idea source product direct from factories, and then bring it to market with the help of AI - to enable automatic product listing and live streaming - at a lower cost. (The concept of matching factory output to consumer demand has also been embraced by Temu and Shein, both wildly successful Asian e-commerce operators.)\nWestern retailers and brands could learn a great deal from events like the Alibaba E-Commerce Expo. It\u2019s a glimpse of a future with an ascendant Asian middle class, who live digitally and love to shop online, and Asian e-commerce companies welcoming - and advancing upon - the world."

    "text": "Ajay Prasad is the CEO of GMR Web Team, a full-service healthcare digital marketing agency focused on patient acquisition and retention.\ngetty \nThe dermatology industry is poised to be worth $3.14 billion by 2032, largely due to the population growing, disposable incomes rising and health insurance coverage increasing. It's safe to say that this industry is going to become more competitive for practitioners.\nFurthermore, consumerism has taken over the healthcare industry, and dermatology is no exception. Patients are behaving more like shoppers, and nearly 60% of adults use the internet to look for health-related information. Patients are more informed about their healthcare needs, and they are often actively involved in the decision-making process.\nIn this changing healthcare landscape, it's crucial for dermatology practices to adopt digital marketing strategies that connect with and engage their patients.\nFind Your Way In This Changing Healthcare Landscape\nDermatologists can prioritize the following strategies to foster fruitful, long-term patient-provider relationships.\nAdapt To Telemedicine And Technological Advances\nMore and more patients today want digital conveniences like online appointment scheduling, automated appointment reminders and telehealth options. One study found that online consultations, professional content on YouTube and chat opportunities are the top three unmet needs of dermatology patients.\nWhile adapting to technological advances, don't forget to take advantage of the basics, like building and maintaining a user-friendly website and robust online presence, as these set the stage for connecting and engaging with your prospective patients.\nAlso, consider harnessing the power of social media, review websites and patient testimonials to shape patients' dermatology choices. By engaging with patients on social media platforms, sharing educational content and showcasing positive patient experiences, you can increase your practice's visibility and attract more new patients.\nEngage And Educate Your Community\nCommunity engagement can be a big win for dermatologists when it comes to building credibility. By participating in health fairs, community events and workshops, you can raise awareness around skincare and conditions and emerge as a thought leader in skin health.\nAlso, consider partnering with local businesses to provide your patients with integrated and comprehensive support while ultimately creating a holistic healthcare ecosystem. For instance, you can facilitate medication management and adherence by partnering with pharmacies that offer medication synchronization programs, medication delivery services, etc.\nPersonalize Your Marketing Strategies\nPersonalizing healthcare marketing strategies involves tailoring your efforts to suit patients' unique preferences and needs. You can do this by analyzing your patient data to find out what issues affect them the most, which type of content they are most interested in and what communication channels they prefer. This will help you improve the effectiveness and relevance of your healthcare communications, which will help you better engage with your current and prospective patients.\nPrioritize Data Security And Patient Privacy\nAs technology advances, so does cybercrime. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) sets strict standards for protecting patient information, so above all, make sure your patient communication channels are secure and that you're properly protecting all patient data from unauthorized interception.\nBeyond data security, implementing transparent data privacy practices is crucial for maintaining patient-provider relationships. You can achieve this through the following strategies:\n\u2022 Clear communication: Always provide patients with clear information on how their data is collected and what purposes you'll use it for.\n\u2022 Informed consent: Make sure you obtain informed consent from your patients before sharing their data. This ensures that patients know and understand what data will be collected and who will have access to it.\n\u2022 Feedback and accountability: Always ask your patients for feedback on their experiences with your data practices. This feedback can help you improve trust and transparency.\nSumming Up\nThese strategies can help you build a thriving dermatology practice that focuses on patient engagement and building credibility and trust. As consumerism continues to shape the healthcare industry, stay attuned to evolving trends to help you continue to deliver high-quality care to your patients.\nForbes Agency Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies.

    "text": "Sally Mueller, CEO & Co-Founder\nWomaness \nMenopause is a natural phase in a woman's life, yet it has been overlooked and stigmatized for far too long. Recently, influential figures like Drew Barrymore, Michelle Obama, and Naomi Watts are using their platforms to speak out about their experiences and support products that can help ease the transition. Although menopause is gaining some media attention, there is still a need for more effective symptom management, which presents an opportunity for companies to innovate. According to McKinsey, the global market potential to address menopausal symptoms ranges from $120 billion to $350 billion, serving over 450 million women worldwide. As one of the most underserved female health conditions, there is enormous potential for innovative treatments in the realm of women's health.\nSally Mueller is the CEO & Co-Founder of Womaness, a company that offers a collection of modern menopause products designed by women for women. Their collection includes skincare, supplements, feminine care, and sexual wellness products that cater to women in their 40s, 50s, and beyond. Their mission is to empower women to feel confident and beautiful as they age by providing innovative wellness products tailored to the evolving needs of women. Their clinically tested products support women through various challenges of aging, such as hot flashes, dry skin, and sleep issues, helping them embrace the art of aging gracefully.\nBefore establishing Womaness, Mueller's professional path began at Target, where she joined as a merchandising executive straight out of college in 1987. During her 25 years at Target, Mueller transitioned from merchandising to significant positions in marketing. She had a natural talent for identifying and influencing consumer behavior and trends. While working at Target, she closely collaborated with designers to create unique products that offer a fresh perspective on the company's fashion and home goods collections. Her contribution was crucial in transforming Target into the destination for chic and cost-effective merchandise.\nAfter leaving Target, Mueller launched her consultancy, advising retailers and brands on innovating and capturing new markets. It was during her late forties, amidst a flurry of professional success and global travel, that Mueller found herself confronting the personal and widely unaddressed challenges of menopause. After experiencing difficulty finding relief for her menopause-related symptoms, she decided to seek help from the Mayo Clinic. However, she quickly discovered that the available solutions and products were outdated and ineffective. This experience led to a realization: women today are in need of more innovative and informative solutions that align with modern standards. This realization served as her \"aha\" moment, which inspired her to create Womaness.\nProducts for Menopause Symptoms\nWomaness \nToday, Womaness is a trailblazer in offering products and creating a community. According to Mueller, one of the most profound lessons has been the power of community and conversation. \"We've seen that women seek more than just products\u2014they're looking for connection, understanding, and education around what they're experiencing. Seeing how our platform has fostered a space for women to share, learn, and support each other has been awe-inspiring. This feedback loop between us and our community has been invaluable in shaping our journey, guiding our product development, and refining our message to ensure we're truly serving their needs.\" Mueller said.\nWomaness has also collaborated with a wide array of experts. The professional expert panel includes Dr. Ekta Kapoor, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Shelby Harris, a sleep expert who specializes in Cognitive Behavior Therapy for anxiety and depression, and Dr. Emily Morse Doctor of Human Sexuality, a renowned sexual wellness expert. These relationships are instrumental in providing the women's community with the comprehensive support and guidance they seek.\nMueller shared, \"We've recognized the need for a holistic approach that addresses both the physical and mental transformations women undergo. Despite significant progress in destigmatizing menopause, confusion and stigma persists. Many women find themselves unsure about the stages of menopause, whether it's perimenopause or something else, often failing to connect their experiences with early symptoms. In response, we're refining our brand's focus towards healthy aging, emphasizing menopause and perimenopause. This shift aims to demystify menopause for women, presenting it within the broader, more relatable context of healthy aging. It's a strategic move based on direct feedback from our community over the past two years, demonstrating our commitment to truly understanding and addressing women's needs at this critical stage of life.\"\nWomaness is a groundbreaking company that is transforming the way women experience midlife. The founders, Sally Mueller and Michelle Jacobs, have played a crucial role in changing the narrative surrounding menopause, and their efforts to promote healthy aging, build communities, and empower women have earned widespread recognition. The story of Womaness is a powerful inspiration for entrepreneurs who want to make a difference by addressing the needs of underserved markets.\nShop WomanessWomaness | Wellness, Skin & Body Care | The Art of Aging Well\nWomaness products are available at Womaness.com, Ulta Beauty, and Amazon."

    "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/04/08/the-power-of-first-impressions-5-tips-that-can-impact-your-business/",
    "text": "Stephanie Coughlan, Founder of Image Intelligence.\ngetty \nIn our fast-paced world of business, first impressions can make or break crucial opportunities. Whether you\u2019re meeting a potential client, networking with industry professionals or interviewing a candidate for a job, the impression you convey in those initial moments sets the tone for your future interactions. Understanding the dynamics of first impressions and how to wield them effectively can significantly impact your success in business.\n1. Master the art of nonverbal communication.\nDid you know that eye contact increases trustworthiness? Indeed, research suggests that up to 55% of communication is conveyed through body language. Maintaining appropriate eye contact can enhance perceptions of credibility and reliability. Additionally, smiling is often said to be the first thing anyone notices during an encounter, so let your genuine smile shine through to create a welcoming atmosphere.\n2. Pay attention to body language.\nYour posture can speak volumes about your level of interest and engagement. Bad posture can send a strong message of disinterest, while standing tall and maintaining an open posture may convey confidence and attentiveness. A firm handshake can also exude confidence and warmth, leaving a positive impression.\n3. Harness the power of verbal communication.\nWhile nonverbal cues play the most significant role in forming first impressions, verbal communication is important. While only 7% form the impression based on what you say, it\u2019s even more important how you say it. On top of this, 38% of the message\u2019s individuals communicate face-to-face are noted through how someone speaks. Pay attention to your tone, pace and clarity of speech to ensure your message is conveyed effectively. Consider mirroring the other person\u2019s communication style to establish rapport and build trust.\n4. Elevate your wardrobe details.\nYour wardrobe speaks volumes about your professionalism and attention to detail. In addition to specific clothing choices, grooming, fit and proportion play crucial roles in shaping people\u2019s first impressions. Simple details like neat hair, clean nails and well-fitted attire can speak volumes about our professionalism and attention to detail. When our clothing fits just right and flatters our body\u2019s proportions, it not only boosts our confidence but also sends a message of competence and reliability.\nIn my experience, I\u2019ve found that opting for timeless pieces over passing trends can communicate a sense of authority and timelessness, while overly casual attire might undermine your credibility. Paying attention to the fine details, like choosing polished footwear that complements your overall look, can make a big difference. Selecting understated yet elegant jewelry pieces, such as a classic watch or simple stud earrings, can add a touch of sophistication without overwhelming the overall look. Similarly, a tastefully tied silk scarf can add refinement into an outfit.\nRemember, every detail counts when leaving a positive impression on your audience. Personal grooming, including your hair, nails and skincare and attention to wardrobe details, all contribute to the overall impression you convey. Investing in high-quality, well-fitted clothing can significantly elevate your appearance and even boost your confidence, further enhancing the impression you make.\n5. Understand the power of color.\nColors can evoke emotion and convey messages, making them a powerful tool in shaping perceptions. Consider the message you want to convey when selecting your attire. For example, blue exudes trustworthiness, while red signifies power and passion. Choose colors that align with your personal brand and the message you wish to convey, as they can significantly influence how you are perceived by others.\nConclusion\nFirst impressions are formed in less than a tenth of a second and are challenging to change. By mastering the art of nonverbal and verbal communication, paying attention to body language, elevating your wardrobe details, and understanding the power of color, you can enhance your ability to make positive and lasting impressions that drive success in your professional endeavors.\nRemember, you only get one chance to make a first impression. Make it count.\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?"

    "text": "What Is Business Marketing? \nBusiness marketing involves promotional activities designed to engage, attract, and retain customers.\nNot every business marketing tactic is hyper focused on sales. You use different approaches to guide people through the marketing funnel\u2014from awareness to purchase. And then, address how to keep customers buying.\nHow?\nBy building brand visibility, establishing trust, and positioning your products or services as the best solutions to customer needs.\nB2C vs. B2B Marketing\nThere are two types of business marketing: business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C).\nBoth focus on engaging consumers and promoting products or services. But differ in their target audiences.\nB2B brands target different businesses. While B2C brands sell to individual consumers.\nFor example, Slack is a B2B brand. While beauty company Glossier is B2C.\nB2B and B2C marketing are pretty similar in their tactics (e.g., content marketing, social media, paid ads, etc.). But differences in those target audiences and their needs impact their overall marketing strategies:\nAudiences\nB2B brands sell to business teams. Which have multiple people on them who have to factor in different needs across the company. And account for things like efficiency and return on investment (ROI).\nB2C marketing, on the other hand, can focus more on meeting the emotional and unique needs of individuals\u2014ones who can make faster buying decisions on their own.\nRelationship Lengths\nB2B often involves longer sales cycles and deeper, ongoing relationships. While B2C transactions are often more singular and based on immediate needs.\nContent Focuses\nB2B marketing content tends to be more detailed, technical, and focused on demonstrating the ROI of the product or service. Like this Salesforce blog post that outlines the benefits of a new feature. And walks developers through its installation.\nB2C marketing messaging is usually simpler. And focuses on immediate benefits and connecting with consumers on an emotional level.\nTake the Wearing Warby series from Warby Parker, which helps prospective customers get to know different customers who wear the brand\u2019s glasses.\nSales Volumes and Costs\nB2B transactions usually involve larger volumes and higher costs compared to B2C transactions. Which are typically smaller in scale.\nOutbound vs. Inbound Business Marketing\nUse both outbound and inbound business marketing to attract customers at different points in their sales journey. Helping you nurture more customer relationships and drive revenue.\nOutbound marketing primarily focuses on driving sales through explicit product or service promotion. Usually through paid ads or widespread email campaigns. \nLike this Halloween Pepsi ad that took a playful dig at its main competition:\nImage Source: Buzz in a Box\nIt can quickly reach a lot of prospects. And gives you control over who your promotional content lands in front of.\nOn the other hand, inbound marketing takes a \u201csofter,\u201d less sales-centric approach. Its goal is to naturally attract new customers (and keep existing ones happy) through valuable, relevant content. Like SEO articles or social media posts.\nFor example, this Gymshark blog post on protective gym hairstyles. While it mentions relevant Gymshark products, they\u2019re not the main focus. Helpful tips are.\nHow to Market Your Business: Foundational Best Practices\nDon\u2019t just choose random business marketing tactics and hope for the best. Before you start, do your homework to create a clear, actionable strategy. One that connects with the right people and lets you get the most out of your hard work and resources.\nSet yourself up for success with these tips:\n1. Conduct Market Research \nAnalyzing your market shows you:\nThe size and growth rate of your market \nWho your main competitors are \nThe market share of major players \nAudience demographics \nHow your target audience behaves\nPopular marketing acquisition channels\nYour market\u2019s geographic distribution\nThese insights help you strategically focus your business marketing approach to reach the most relevant potential customers. And stand out from the competition across channels.\nUse Market Explorer to quickly research key market data points.\nThere are three options to choose from to:\nCreate List: Get data based on entering 100 of your own chosen competitors\nFind Competitors: Get data based on entering your website and automatically generating a competitor list\nAnalyze Category: Get data based on selecting your industry\nFor business marketing beginners, we recommend starting with Find Competitors.\nChoose your location and enter your domain name. \nThen, click \u201cResearch a market.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll see a summary report that gives a market overview. Including:\nMarket Consolidation: A scale measuring whether there\u2019s a lot of brands who \u201cown\u201d the market\nKey Players: Who \u201cowns\u201d the market\nMarketing Domains: How many brands were identified as competitors\nMarket Traffic: Total traffic of all marketing domains over a certain time period\nMarket Traffic Cost: The total estimated costs across domains to rank for organic keywords over a certain time period\nMarket Size: Total market demand\nTo dig deeper, click on the \u201cAudience\u201d tab. This report offers insights into audience demographics, socioeconomic data, and online behavior. Including which websites people are visiting.\nScroll down to see each category\u2019s report.\nAs an example, here\u2019s Demographics:\nAfter you\u2019re done, head to the \u201cBenchmarking\u201d tab to see different trends in competitor traffic, including where they focus their traffic generation efforts. \nAnd look at the \u201cSocial Media Distribution Strategy\u201d chart to understand which platforms are used the most.\n2. Set Clear Goals \nBefore you figure out how you want to market your business, you need to set clear goals.\nWhy?\nSo you\u2019ll be able to:\nPick channels that best support those aims\nMeasure whether your efforts are working\nUnderstand when you need to make changes to your marketing plan\nUse the SMART framework to create focused goals\u2014ones that are Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.\nSay you want to boost web traffic. A SMART version of that goal would be:\n\u201cOur goal is to increase web traffic by X% by Y date. This will help us grow our brand visibility.\u201d \nFurther reading: Marketing Strategy 101: A 7-Step Plan for Beginners\n3. Use the 4 P\u2019s of Marketing as a Roadmap\nAlso known as the marketing mix, the 4\u2019Ps of Marketing emphasize four key areas that impact your overall business marketing strategy:\nProduct: What you\u2019ll be selling and to who\nPrice: How much you\u2019ll sell your product or service for\nPlace: Where you\u2019ll sell\nPromotion: Where and how you\u2019ll market your product or service\nYou should be able to clearly define each \u201cP\u201d for your business. And, more importantly, be able to explain the \u201cwhys\u201d behind those responses.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re selling organic skincare products. For \u201cProduct,\u201d you wouldn\u2019t just list \u201cbody lotions and face creams.\u201d You\u2019d want to also outline why you use certain ingredients and what benefits they offer customers.\nYour responses help you establish a clear value proposition that shows what your brand brings to the table. And decide on the best ways to convey that value to attract customers and drive sales.\n4. Use Topic Research to Guide Your Content Ideas\nContent brainstorming is key for developing business marketing content and messages that resonate with your target audience.\nIt needs to be grounded in what potential customers truly need and want\u2014not just what you think they need or want. Otherwise, you risk spending time and money on marketing that falls flat.\nEnter Topic Research. This tool shows you trending topics and subtopics related to your industry. Which helps you see what potential customers are interested in. \nUse these ideas to shape your business marketing. And tackle customer pain points that competitors\u2019 haven\u2019t addressed as much.\nType in a starting topic. Then, pick your country from the drop-down menu and click \u201cGet content ideas.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll see connected topics pop up on cards, each showing popular headlines. Use the \u201cPrioritize topics\u201d drop-down to sort them by volume, ranking difficulty, or topic efficiency. \nOr click the \u201cTrending subtopics first\u201d toggle button to see what topics currently have the most interest.\nClick the \u201cShow more\u201d button to see additional information, including related searches, questions, and sub-topics.\nIf you\u2019d like to see the information presented differently, you can also choose one of the \u201cExplorer,\u201d \u201cOverview,\u201d or \u201cMind Map\u201d options. \nFor instance, this is what Mind Map looks like:\nOnce you\u2019ve got your ideas together, check out our copywriting guide and content writing guide for tips on creating high-quality short- and long-form content.\n5. Include Relevant Keywords in Digital Content\nOptimizing your digital marketing content with strategic keywords, or search terms, is important for business marketing.\nWhy?\nBecause when you naturally incorporate them, your content has a better chance of being listed on related Google\u2019s search engine results pages (SERPs). Which gets your brand name in front of more people.\nAnd the higher you rank, the more likely it is that potential customers will click through to your page. As noted in a Backlinko study, the average click-through-rate (CTR) for the top search result on Google was 10 times greater than the CTR for the 10th spot.\nStart by thinking of what people might search when looking for a business like yours. Say you own a dog training and daycare business. Potential phrases could include:\nDog trainer near me\nDog training\nDoggy daycare\nPetsitting service \nHow to choose a dog trainer\nHow to train your dog\nAffordable dog sitting\nOnce you have your list of starting, or seed, keywords, use Keyword Overview to analyze those terms. And discover more related keywords.\nCopy and paste or type them into the Keyword Overview search bar. Then, select your country and city from the drop-down menu. Click \u201cSearch.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll see a Bulk Keyword Analysis report. Focus on each one\u2019s:\nIntent: The reason why someone is searching for that keyword (Navigational, Informational, Commercial, Transactional)\nVolume: How many monthly searches that keyword receives\nKD% (Keyword Difficulty): How easy or difficult it is to rank for that keyword\nLook for keywords with a low to medium difficulty that have at least 100 monthly searches. This will help you focus on keywords with realistic ranking potential and decent traffic.\nIf you want to explore a keyword in more detail, simply click on it to open the Overview report.\nScroll down to see variations of the keyword, related questions, and keyword clusters (related groups of keywords).\nAs you scale your business marketing efforts, you\u2019ll also want to scale your tech toolkit to support your changing needs.\nWith over 55 tools, Semrush\u2019s user-friendly platform gives you flexible options that make it easy to market your business\u2014whether you\u2019re B2B or B2C.\nGet started today with a free account."

    "text": "What Is Digital Advertising?\nAdvertising is digital when you use online platforms to promote your products and services. Digital ads appear on search engines, social media, and websites.\nUnlike traditional advertising on TV, radio, or print, digital ads have the advantage of precise targeting. They also let you personalize ad content to fit your intended recipients and the context of their online activities.\nFor instance, if someone in your target demographic searches for \"buy dog food\" on Google, they might see a search ad for your dog food delivery service. This ad is personalized based on your settings and the target audience\u2019s search. The algorithm knows this is a product type the audience is already interested in.\nDigital advertising allows you to reach your audience on online platforms while they\u2019re actively seeking information and entertainment. This makes your message more engaging since your ad is relevant to their current online activities and preferences.\nBenefits of Digital Ads\nDigital advertising has a lot of advantages:\nIt reaches more people. Digital platforms offer access to a vast online audience (significantly larger than any single traditional medium can provide).\nIt targets the right audience. Advanced targeting options let you use interests, behaviors, and engagement levels when setting audience criteria.\nIt\u2019s cost-effective. Digital ads are often budget-friendly. Accessible pricing combined with precise targeting options makes it possible to optimize your ad spend to focus on users who show the most interest.\nIt\u2019s measurable. You gain detailed insights with specific metrics like click-through rates, conversion rates, and engagement levels. This offers a clear picture of your campaign's performance and areas for improvement.\nThe way you pay for digital ad campaigns varies depending on the platform and ad type. \nThe three most common pricing models are:\nCost Per Click (CPC): You pay each time someone clicks on your ad\nCost Per Mille (CPM): You pay for every thousand impressions your ad receives\nCost Per Action (CPA): You pay when someone takes a specific action, like buying a product\nWhat Are the Different Types of Digital Advertising?\nUse different types of digital advertising campaigns to meet different marketing goals. \nWe can split digital ads into the following categories:\nSearch engine advertising \nSocial media advertising\nContent and native advertising\nMobile advertising\nVisual and audio advertising\nOther types of advertising\nLet\u2019s look at the specific advertising formats within each category.\nSearch Engine Advertising\nSearch engine advertising helps show your ads to users searching for products or services like yours on search engines.\nHere are five common types of search engine ads:\n1. Search Ads\nDirectly connect with individuals searching for keywords related to your business through search ads. \nThese are text-based advertisements that appear on search engine results pages (SERPs). They're positioned alongside organic search results and are clearly labeled as ads. \nLike this:\nSearch ads give you the flexibility to customize your ad's content, target specific keywords used in searches, and manage your budget to optimize your campaign performance.\nSearch ads can be a big help in attracting relevant traffic to your website. But you need to choose the right keywords.\nHow?\nLook into your competitor\u2019s search ad strategy to find: \nWhat keywords they are bidding on\nWhat keywords their ads appeared for recently\nHow much are they paying per ad click\nFind these insights and more with Advertising Research.\nOpen the tool, enter your competitor's domain, and click \"Search.\"\nIn the default \"Positions\" tab, scroll down to \u201cPaid Search Positions.\u201d \nHere, in the \u201cKeyword\u201d column, you\u2019ll see the terms your competitor\u2019s ads rank for in Google's paid search results. Check out the \u201cCPC\u201d column to see how much they're paying for each click.\nNext, click \"Ads History.\"\nYou'll see a snapshot of the keywords your competitor's ad has ranked for recently.\nBased on these insights, build your keyword strategy. Plan to improve on what they\u2019re offering. Or look for gaps\u2014keywords they're missing. \nFor instance, if they haven't focused on \"eco-friendly running shoes\" and your product fits that description, targeting this keyword could attract customers they're not. With this keyword strategy, you're not competing head-on. You're capturing audiences in niches they're overlooking.\nSetting a deliberate keyword strategy can make your ads more cost-effective. And potentially increase your return by reaching interested buyers more efficiently.\n2. Display Ads\nUse display ads to show up on websites that are part of a search engine's advertising network. Like Google Display Network.\nHere\u2019s an example of a display ad on Forbes\u2019 homepage:\nThese ads (which may include images or videos) target users based on their interests and web browsing behavior. \nFor example, if you sell art supplies, you may set your display ads to appear on art-related websites. That way, you reach users who are likely to be interested in your products.\nDisplay ads help increase brand visibility and attract potential customers to your website.\nLike search ads, competitive analysis is key to creating effective display ad campaigns. When you learn what's working for competitors (and what's not), you can create better display ads that drive greater results.\nThe AdClarity tool from Semrush can help you look into your competitor's display ad campaigns, revealing:\nThe ad platforms they're using\nTheir display advertising spend\nTheir campaign's performance stats\nTheir ad\u2019s messaging and visuals\nOpen the tool and enter your competitor's domain. Then click \u201cSubmit.\u201d\nYou'll be taken to the main dashboard. It looks like this:\nScroll down to the \"Top Ads\" widget. Here, you'll see display ads from your competitors, other businesses in your industry, and those competing for similar ad space. \nNotice: The \u201cTop Ads\u201d section provides data on the number of impressions the ad received, how long the ad has been running (duration), and how recently it was seen (recency).\nClick on any ad to see a full campaign report.\nUse these insights to tailor your own display ad strategy. \nFocus on ads with high impressions to understand placement strategies that are capturing attention. Analyze successful ads for creative inspiration. And ensure your visuals are compelling enough to stand out.\n3. Shopping Ads\nAlso called Product Listing Ads (PLAs), shopping ads display your products directly in search results. These ads feature product images, prices, store names, and other decision-making details. \nWhen users search for a product, such as \"headphones,\" they see a presentation of what you offer alongside similar products from other sellers. \nShopping ads are great for ecommerce businesses because they enable shoppers to quickly compare products on the SERP and easily make purchase decisions. \nUse the PLA Research tool from Semrush to analyze competitors\u2019 PLAs, gain insights to create your own ecommerce strategy, and look at ad content plus keywords in detail.\nOpen the tool. Enter your competitor's domain, select a location from the drop-down if you want to, and click \"Search.\"\nOn the default \"Positions\" tab, scroll down to the \u201cPLA Positions\u201d section. Look for the \u201cKeyword\u201d column to see the list of keywords that trigger your competitor's product ads to appear on the SERP.\nHead to the \"Competitors\" tab to find more domain names competing for the same keywords.\nUse these insights to target the right keywords for your PLAs. Ideally, ones that have lower competition and higher paid traffic.\n4. Local Search Ads\nTarget users who are searching for specific services or products near their physical location with local search ads. \nLike: \"Plumber near me.\"\nLocal search ads act as a digital signpost. They guide potential customers directly to your business at the very moment they're ready to make a purchase from a business like yours. \nThese ads even display critical information like your company\u2019s location, contact details, and hours of operation. \n5. Dynamic Search Ads\nDynamic search ads (DSAs) appear in Google search results, blending in seamlessly with other ads. But they are distinguished by being dynamically generated. Their content is automatically created based on your website. \nHere\u2019s an example:\nDSAs use Google's web crawling technology to extend your reach without manual keyword selection. They help you find potential customers your regular ads might not reach by automatically covering more search terms.\nThey also save you the trouble of writing ad copy. DSAs use the content from your website directly. For them to be effective, your website's content must be clear and well-organized.\nDynamic search ads are best for businesses that have a lot of products or update their website often. This way, ads can be shown for every product offered without having to manually set up each ad.\nTarget audiences on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) with social media advertising. \nEach platform offers unique ad formats for different marketing goals. \nFor example, X allows businesses to sponsor trending topics. This can drive brand awareness or bring people's attention to ongoing campaigns.\nHere are six types of digital advertising formats available on social media:\nReach your audience seamlessly on social media with sponsored posts that blend in. \nFor instance, if you're promoting a new coffee blend, a sponsored post targeting users interested in coffee can fit right into their usual social feed. \nSponsored posts look just like ordinary social posts, but they\u2019re marked with a \"Sponsored\" or \u201cPromoted\u201d label to indicate they\u2019re an ad. \nThey look like this on X:\nYou pay for these posts to reach a specific audience directly in their news feeds. Choose the audience based on targeting options that include demographics, interests, and behaviors.\nThese flexible targeting options help ensure that potential customers most interested in your offering see your ad. Precision audience selection increases the chances of engagement.\n7. Static Image Ads\nCapture users' attention and encourage them to act with static image ads. They consist of a single image coupled with text. \nThese ads aim to intrigue and inform users as they scroll through their feeds.\nHere\u2019s how they look on Instagram:\nWhen creating a static image ad, you'll choose an image that stands out, write concise, persuasive copy, and include a clear call to action (CTA) like \"Shop Now\" or \"Learn More.\" \nFor instance, if you're advertising handmade jewelry on Pinterest, you want to select a high-quality image that highlights the craftsmanship and beauty of your pieces, then pair it with a message that speaks directly to the viewer's desire for unique accessories.\n8. Carousel Ads\nShowcase multiple images or videos in a single ad unit with carousel ads. Each piece of content in the carousel can link to different pages on your website. \nUsers interact with these ads by swiping through the content, giving them control over the experience. \nHere\u2019s one on Facebook:\nThis format is perfect for when you want to highlight several specific products or tell a sequential story. \nFor example, if your business sells skincare products, you could use carousel ads on Facebook to feature different items, like cleansers, moisturizers, and serums. Each slide could explain the benefits and ingredients, guiding potential customers to see the full range and select products that meet their skin's needs.\n9. Video Ads\nCombine visual and auditory elements to showcase your products with video ads.\nThese can often be more effective in capturing attention than static image ads. The videos start playing automatically as users scroll through their feeds, offering a dynamic way to tell your brand's story.\nHere\u2019s how they look on LinkedIn:\nVideo ads allow for creative storytelling.\nFor example, if you sell clothes, you can create a short, engaging video showcasing your latest collection, highlighting the unique styles and demonstrating how they fit into everyday life.\n10. Stories Ads\nAppear between users' stories on platforms like Instagram and Snapchat with stories ads. These ads last only 24 hours.\nThey look like this:\nThey're full-screen and immersive, giving you a captive audience for your message. \nThese ads can include images or short videos. And they always have a clear call to action, like \"Swipe Up to Shop.\" \nThis format is ideal for time-sensitive offers or promotions. For instance, if you're having a flash sale. The temporary nature creates a sense of urgency. \n11. Message Ads\nDeliver your advertising directly to users' inboxes on platforms such as Facebook Messenger or LinkedIn with message ads.\nHere\u2019s an example from LinkedIn:\nThese ads allow for a more personal interaction. They can look just like a regular message, even initiating a conversation by addressing the recipient by name.\nUse message ads for targeted promotions, special deals, or exclusive information. For example, send a message ad about an upcoming webinar to users who have shown interest in your industry and invite them to attend.\nContent and Native Advertising\nNative ads, often articles or videos, mimic the look and feel of the media format where they appear.\nThe goal is to provide value through content that feels authentic to the platform. The ads are designed to be part of the editorial flow.\nCommon types of content and native ads include:\n12. Sponsored Content\nShare your brand's story or products on third-party websites with sponsored content. It looks just like that site's own articles or videos.\nHere's an example of a sponsored post on Forbes:\nWhen you make sponsor content, you work with the third-party websites to create stories or videos that fit right in with what they usually post. But your sponsored piece contains messaging that\u2019s good for your brand.\nThis type of content is great to draw in readers who are already interested in topics related to your brand. It's a smart way to introduce them to what you offer.\n13. Branded Content\nTell your brand's story through branded content, engaging your audience with narratives that reflect their lifestyles and values without a direct sales pitch.\nThis type of content (often in the form of videos, articles, or social media posts) reinforces your brand's voice and personality. \nHere's an example of branded content created by Casey Neistat featuring Nike:\nWhile branded content often features products, the primary goal is to engage viewers emotionally and strengthen brand loyalty by aligning with their passions, interests, and values.\n14. Influencer Marketing\nTeam up with social media influencers whose followers are part of your target market. Boost your brand or promote your product for direct sales by leveraging their appeal and their followers\u2019 trust.\nInfluencer marketing involves partnering with (and compensating) influencers to create content that naturally includes your products or services. \nHere\u2019s an example of a paid post by an influencer on Instagram:\nThe influencer's endorsement serves as a recommendation to their audience, making it a potent way to influence purchase decisions among their followers. \nThis is especially effective when targeting younger demographics who value authenticity and personal recommendations.\n15. Newsletter Ads\nUse newsletter ads to reach people with specific interests or within specific niches. These ads can range from simple text links to full-banner images. Either way, they are integrated to complement the newsletter's content.\nHere\u2019s an example of a newsletter ad from Ryan Holiday\u2019s Daily Stoic newsletter:\nNewsletter ads are particularly effective for B2B companies or niche products, where targeted communication can directly influence decision-making.\n16. Content Syndication\nRepublish your original content on other websites to reach their audience with content syndication.\nHere\u2019s an example:\nThis tactic allows your blog posts, articles, or videos to appear on sites visited by people interested in topics relevant to your brand. And it leverages the credibility and audience of established platforms to enhance your brand's visibility.\nDistributing your content to reputable third-party sites helps: \nIncrease your brand's exposure\nDrive traffic back to your site\nReach potential customers outside your immediate audience\nMobile Advertising\nMobile advertising aims to specifically target users on smartphones and tablets. \nHere are the common types of digital advertising campaigns used on mobile:\n17. In-App Ads\nDisplay your ads right within the mobile apps your target audience is using. \nIt can be a subtle banner at the bottom of their screen. Or an immersive full-screen ad that appears during their ordinary app interactions. \nHere\u2019s an example of an in-app ad:\nThe goal is to advertise your product in a contextually relevant place. Like sports attire advertised in a fitness tracker app. \nThese ads can be fine-tuned to target users based on detailed criteria, including their app usage patterns, interests, and demographic data. This helps your message reach those most likely to engage with your brand.\n18. SMS Marketing\nSend concise, direct messages to your audience with SMS ads. These can include sales alerts, appointment reminders, or exclusive offers.\nHere\u2019s an example:\nBecause text messages are highly personal and have high engagement rates, SMS ads are an incredibly effective way to activate people who have opted in to receive your messages. \nThey are ideal for time-sensitive promotions or important notifications.\n19. Mobile Search Ads\nPlace ads on mobile search results to instantly reach users on their phones.\nThese ads are specially designed for mobile. They often feature functionality intended to drive immediate action, like click-to-call buttons or location maps that provide driving directions.\nHere\u2019s how it looks:\nIf you're running a local service business, such as plumbing or other repair, mobile search ads can help you connect with users searching urgently for help nearby. You raise awareness about your offerings and make it easy for them to contact you. \nOther Types of Digital Advertising\nWe\u2019ve covered most of the conventional types of digital advertising. But there are still some unique and innovative ad types you should know about.\nHere are seven:\nCapture attention on websites with banner ads. They appear as graphics at the top, bottom, or sides of the site.\nThey can be static images or animations that catch the user's eye and encourage clicks.\nHere\u2019s an example of a banner ad on The New York Times homepage:\nWith banner ads, you can target specific websites frequented by your desired audience. And ensure your message is seen in relevant contexts.\nFor example, if you have a software company, you might use display ads on tech forums to showcase the features of your latest product release. Include a clear CTA, like \"Learn More\" or \"Free Trial.\"\n21. Audio Ads\nEngage listeners with audio ads on podcasts, streaming music services, and internet radio. These ads are purely auditory, so your message needs to be clear and memorable. \nFor instance, if you're promoting a new fitness product, a catchy audio ad on a popular fitness podcast can intrigue listeners and direct them to your landing page. \nPlatforms like Spotify have robust ad programs.\nAudio ads are particularly effective for targeting audiences based on listening preferences and habits. And they offer a personal touch by engaging through headphones. They often get a high level of attention.\n22. Affiliate Marketing\nCollaborate with partners (\"affiliates\u201d) to promote your products through affiliate marketing. \nThese partners could be anyone\u2014bloggers, influencers, or people with dedicated online followings. In return for promoting your product, they earn a commission for each sale or lead they generate. \nLet\u2019s say you sell fitness-related products. Partner with fitness bloggers who will review and recommend your products to their followers. Give them a specific URL with a tracking code you can trace back to them. For each purchase their referred followers make, you pay them $20.\nHere's an example of a review article on CNET that includes an affiliate link:\nAffiliate marketing is highly effective for expansion. You benefit from the audiences and credibility your partners have built, without needing to create that audience yourself.\n23. Gmail Ads\nAppear directly in Gmail users' inboxes with Gmail ads. They show up at the top of a user's inbox in the \u201cPromotions\u201d or \u201cSocial\u201d tabs. \nThese ads look like regular emails until they are opened, revealing a full advertising message inside.\nHere\u2019s an example:\nGmail allows you to target users based on their email activity. \nFor instance, if you offer travel deals, target people who have received emails from other travel services, presenting your offers as timely and relevant alternatives.\nIt\u2019s a unique way to present your message directly where your audience manages their daily communications. \n24. Amazon Ads\nIf your products are listed for sale on Amazon, you can showcase them to shoppers with Amazon Ads. \nThese ads appear in search results and on product pages, providing visibility right at the point of purchase. They highlight your products with images, pricing, and customer ratings. \nAmazon's vast data on shopping behavior allows for precise targeting. Which helps you reach consumers who are already interested in products like yours.\n25. Retargeting Ads\nReconnect with users who previously visited your website with retargeting ads.\nBy using cookies, these ads find past visitors wherever they may be across the web. Reminding them of the products they viewed or encouraging them to complete a purchase back on your site. \nHere\u2019s an example:\nRetargeting is highly effective. It keeps your brand and the specific products of interest top of mind for potential customers.\n26. AR/VR Ads\nCreate immersive advertising experiences with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). \nThese ads engage users by:\nBlending digital elements with the real world (AR)\nCreating a fully virtual environment (VR)\nAn AR ad might let users see how furniture would look in their home using their smartphone camera. A VR ad could transport users to a virtual world where they can interact with your product. \nThese ads are especially effective for products that benefit from experiential marketing. They offer a unique and memorable way to showcase features and benefits.\nHere\u2019s an example of Burger King leveraging AR in its ad:\nHow to Pick the Best Digital Advertising Type\nTo ensure your marketing efforts are as effective as possible, select digital advertising types that align with your goals and audience. \nHere are a few factors to keep in mind:\nYour target audience: Understanding your customers\u2019 habits, preferences, and online behavior is key. For instance, younger audiences might be more engaged with social media ads, while professionals may respond better to LinkedIn.\nCampaign goals: Establish what you want to achieve with your campaign. If brand awareness is your goal, display or video ads might be most effective. For direct sales, search ads or affiliate marketing could be more suitable.\nBudget constraints: Some ad types are more cost-effective than others. Programmatic ads can be optimized for efficiency, while influencer marketing might require a significant investment but offers high engagement rates.\nContent type: The nature of your product or service can also dictate the ad type. Complex products might benefit from detailed explanation in video ads, whereas simple product offers can excel in static image ads.\nPlatform compatibility: Certain products might perform better on specific platforms. For example, visually appealing products like fashion or home decor thrive on visual-centric platforms like Instagram or Pinterest.\nUsing more than one type of digital ad can help you reach more people and drive better returns for your campaign. \nFor example, you could use search ads to attract people looking to buy something immediately. And at the same time, use social media ads to get more people familiar with your brand.\nUse different types of digital ads to connect with customers at different times. This will make your overall advertising strategy more complete.\nThese two steps will inform a more effective strategy:\n1) Understanding your market\n2) Analyzing your competitors\nSemrush offers 55+ tools for market research and competitive analysis.

    "text": "What Is Video Marketing? \nVideo marketing is when you use video content to promote a brand, product, service, or cause. \nIt involves planning, creating, editing, and sharing videos for different mediums. From social media platforms to websites and vlogs.\nMarketing videos can help generate engagement, brand awareness, and leads. This is especially true if your video gets a lot of traction on social media platforms. Like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.\nFor example, cosmetics brand Glossier created a video to promote its foundation and concealer. It generated over 391,000 views.\nVideos are more dynamic and interactive than images or text. And easy for viewers to share. \nBut to reap the benefits, it's essential to have a well-planned video marketing strategy. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover in this guide.\nVideo Marketing Benefits \nOne of the main benefits of video marketing is more engagement. \nA study on what makes news posts engaging found that news articles containing videos get more engagement. Include shares, likes, and comments on social media. Than those with photos only. \nThis is because video content is often more engaging than static images. And easier to digest than text. \nFor example, UNILAD shared a video on road marking. It got 155,000 million views, 4,400 comments, and 149,000 reactions.\nMore social media engagement can translate into increased exposure for your brand.\nAdditionally, user engagement is a ranking signal on Instagram. And other social channels. So, the more people interact with your content, the greater its reach across the platform.\nWebsite Traffic \nNinety-one percent of marketers say video content helps them get more website traffic, according to a Wyzowl survey. Because videos tend to be more shareable than other types of content. \nVideos can also help you get backlinks from other websites and blogs. \nUse relevant keywords in video titles, descriptions, and captions. To further increase the reach of your marketing videos. This can boost your SEO efforts. Potentially leading to more traffic. And higher rankings in search results, too.\nLeads and Sales\nEighty-seven percent of the companies surveyed by Wyzowl say video marketing helps them increase sales.\nVideos featuring product demos, information, and tutorials can influence purchasing decisions. While allowing consumers to discover new brands and products. \nIt helps leads better understand and research products or services. Which can further drive sales.\nMobile User Targeting\nVideos can help you reach your target market. And keep their attention. \nAccording to a Google survey, 55% of consumers say they watch videos on their phones while shopping in-store. \nMore than half of respondents say online videos help them decide on a brand or product. This could be a product comparison, tutorial, or review. \nFor example, the video below shows viewers how to use an air fryer. It\u2019s around 13 minutes long. And covers everything a consumer would want to know before buying.\nVideo marketing can establish trust by providing a more personal and engaging experience for viewers. Allowing them to connect with your brand or message on a deeper level. \nVideos allow you to showcase your expertise, share valuable insights, and demonstrate transparency. Helping to build credibility and authenticity. \nLike this video by HomeDepot: \nIt provides vital information consumers will need when tackling a home project.\nSeeing real people and real situations featured in your videos can also create a sense of reliability and sincerity. Fostering trust between the audience and your brand.\nAsk your customers for video testimonials. Share them on your site and social media pages to establish credibility.\nFurther reading: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to User-Generated Content (Definition, Examples, and Tips)\nTypes of Marketing Videos\nUse a variety of marketing videos to attract, nurture, and convert customers.\nDemo Videos\nUse demonstration videos to show how a product works. Highlight unboxings, installation, configurations, and key features.\nDemo videos should be educational. Their role is to help viewers understand the \"how-to\" behind a product or service.\nFor example, this short video shows the Ring Door View camera in action. Viewers can see everyday people using the camera and app. \nBrand Videos\nCreate brand videos to showcase your company's mission, values, or products. And connect with your audience on a more personal level.\nThis type of content uses storytelling to evoke emotions, get people's attention, and raise brand awareness. It can take various forms. From short documentaries and interviews to animated videos.\nA great example is Apple's \"Think Different\" video. Which highlights the brand's mission to change the world. It encapsulates Apple's innovative spirit. While encouraging viewers to embrace their uniqueness.\nEvent Videos\nEvent videos are a great way to create buzz. And boost ticket sales. \nUse this type of video to promote the following events: \nSeminars\nCorporate fairs\nVirtual job fairs\nAwards ceremonies\nTrade shows\nAnother option is to create event recap videos. This helps show leads what they missed out on. And can increase future sales. \nFor example, this post-event video appeals to viewers who were unable to attend Content Marketing World. It summarizes the event, highlights key moments, and features snippets of interviews.\nExpert Interviews\nInterview videos can provide value to your target audience. And help you build credibility.\nDepending on your goals, you might interview third-party experts or internal stakeholders.\nLike this YouTube video from nutrition company Athletic Greens. Which features Dr. Andrew Huberman talking about gut flora. The brand sells products that support gut health. And this type of content can help lend credibility to its ingredients. \nEducational or How-To Videos\nEducational and how-to videos should address common challenges or problems. To educate potential and current customers on topics related to your products. \nThey\u2019re also great for highlighting a product's key features and benefits. And why they matter to customers.\nA good example is this marketing video from Semrush. Which shows viewers how to create engaging content that ranks on Google's first page.\nThe video focuses on the content production process. And offers actionable tips on how to improve and refine your writing for higher rankings.\nExplainer Videos\nExplainer videos provide educational content. With a focus on specific products or services. They usually appeal to potential buyers in the awareness or consideration stage.\nFor instance, you could make a video that shows customers what your product does. And why it's relevant to them. Focus on a problem they're facing. And explain how the product can help.\nThe video below shows how Google Wi-Fi can boost internet speed. It uses animations to explain the technology behind the brand's Wi-Fi system. In a manner anyone can understand.\nThis type of content is often short. Offering simple solutions to complex problems.\nBy comparison, demo videos go into more detail about the product. And its features. They\u2019re also more suitable for customers in the conversion stage.\nAnimated Videos\nCompanies can use animations for most types of videos. Especially those that tell a story. Or explain complex concepts.\nWith this approach, you can get your point across quickly. And potentially reach a wider audience. \nFor example, this animated video uses fictional characters. It depicts real-life situations where customers can pay with Amazon One. And shows how the product works in a clear, easy-to-understand manner. \nCase Study and Customer Testimonial Videos\nCase studies and customer testimonial videos serve as social proof. This helps instill trust in your brand. And turn prospects into paying customers.\nFor instance, we presented an SEO case study on a bakery. By using our SEO tools, the bakery grew mobile organic traffic by 460%.\nShowcasing statistics and testimonials from real users is compelling. And may help increase customer trust. If a customer trusts your brand, they\u2019re more likely to take the desired action. Such as buying a product. \nLive Videos\nLive video enables viewers to interact with your content in real time. Which can lead to higher engagement.\nFor example, live Q&A videos allow you to answer customers' questions. And connect with your audience on a personal level. Livestreams are also ideal for covering events. Like a product launch. And sharing quick, interesting facts on social channels.\n360\u00b0 and Virtual Reality Videos\nAccording to Google research, 360-degree video ads have higher click-through rates. And get 41% more views, shares, and subscribers than regular video ads. \nThey enable viewers to virtually explore a location or product from every angle. \nFor example, real estate agencies use this format to showcase apartments or houses in an immersive way. Customers can virtually walk through each room, see the floor plans, and imagine themselves living there. \nSimilarly, virtual reality videos make use of headsets and other devices to create an immersive experience. Viewers can explore real or imagined locations. And interact with the environment around them.\nEither type of video can help you captivate and delight your audience. \nAugmented Reality Videos\nThese marketing videos blend digital elements with real-world objects or locations. \nFor example, customers can use the IKEA Place app to virtually customize their living spaces. If someone wants to buy a new desk or rug, they can scan their office with a smartphone. And see how it would look in their home.\nThis technology enables brands to create interactive experiences. And add new dimensions to storytelling. \nPersonalized Video Messages\nPersonalized videos enable you to deliver customized content to individuals or groups of customers.\nFor example, Nike created over 100,000 personalized animated videos for Nike+ members. Based on fitness data, location, and other factors.\nConsider recording personalized videos for high-profile customers who want to know more about specific products or services. \nOr, create custom video messages. To thank customers for their business, wish them happy holidays, or celebrate milestones.\nPersonalized video messages can help you drive sales. And boost customer satisfaction.\nHow to Create an Effective Video Marketing Strategy\nVideo content marketing will look different from brand to brand. Depending on the company's size, budget, industry, and target audience.\nHowever, most campaigns share some common steps. Which you should take into account when crafting a video strategy.\n1. Align Goals with the Marketing Funnel\nA good starting point is to set video goals for your campaigns. For instance, you may want to reach more customers. Or create buzz around your brand. \nConsider the different stages of the marketing funnel when setting goals. And create content that aligns with those goals.\nA marketing funnel, or conversion funnel, has multiple stages that reflect the buyer's journey. \nThese stages may differ from one business to the next. But usually include the following:\nAwareness: Potential customers become familiar with your brand and product\nConsideration: At this stage, you'll nurture prospects. And position your product as a solution to their pain points.\nConversion: Shoppers are already interested in your products. But need an extra push to take the final step. And make a purchase.\nLoyalty: At this point, you'll want to follow up with customers who've made a purchase. And focus on building lasting relationships. The goal is to earn their loyalty and drive repeat business.\nCustomers at different stages of the funnel have different needs. It\u2019s crucial to adapt your video marketing efforts to each stage of the buyer\u2019s journey.\nAttract in the Awareness Stage \nBuyers in the awareness stage know little about your brand. Or what you sell. \nFor instance, a potential customer may have liked your Facebook page. But didn't look further into your products.\nAt this stage, you'll set a goal to drive brand awareness. By telling the story behind your products through video. The content should inspire, educate, and inform prospects. Rather than sell.\nA good example is this brand video from Shopify. Which revolves around entrepreneurship.\nAlthough it barely mentions the brand's name, it shows how Shopify gives people the freedom to run their own businesses.\nConvert in the Consideration Stage\nCustomers in the consideration stage are already interested in your brand and products.\nNow is the time to answer their questions. And address pain points. And show how your products would fit into their lives.\nFor example, share educational or how-to videos, case studies, or expert interviews.\nLet's say you\u2019re an affiliate marketer who promotes video editing software for small business owners.\nConsider creating a series of videos on relevant topics like:\nWhat is video marketing?\nHow to use video content for brand promotion\nHow to create a video campaign using [a specific tool you\u2019re promoting]\n10 Video marketing tips from industry experts\n15+ Must-have video editing tools for marketing teams\n5 Steps to a successful video marketing strategy\nFocus on educating viewers. While highlighting the benefits of your products or services. Refrain from being overly promotional.\nThe goal here is to spark interest. And move prospects further down the funnel.\nClose in the Conversion Stage\nNow is the time to give customers the push they need to make a purchase.\nFor instance, share demo or live videos. To show your product in action. Customer testimonial videos and case studies can boost conversion rates, too.\nLike this video that shows small business owners how they can benefit from a Semrush subscription: \nDelight Customers in the Loyalty Stage \nGo one step further and create videos to delight customers who've purchased your products. Think of it as a way to provide further value.\nDepending on what you sell, you may create onboarding videos, product videos, or advanced video guides. Webinars can be helpful, too. Especially when it comes to more technical products or services.\nSay you offer a software program for small businesses.\nCustomers have already paid for it. And know how it works. But you can create a series of videos to help them derive more value.\nShowcase hidden features, expert tips, or shortcuts.\nFurther reading: 65 Customer Retention Statistics You Need to Know\n2. Define Your Target Audience \nNext, create a customer profile that reflects your target audience. This can help maximize your marketing efforts. By getting your videos in front of the right people. \nLearn more about your target customers through the following ways:\nSurveys\nIndustry reports\nMarket research \nWebsite analytics\nSocial media analytics \nUse demographic information to decide which types of marketing videos to create. And come up with topics that will resonate with them. \nFor example, if you have a skincare line, you might target women between 25 and 45 years old who live in the U.S. And earn at least $80,000 per year. \nThis demographic might benefit from product tutorial videos, comparisons, and real-user makeovers. \n3. Plan Video Topics and Formats\nDetermine what story you want to tell. And how you're going to tell it. \nShort videos are great for sharing quick tips. Or advertising a product. These can be a good choice for Instagram or Facebook.\nFor example, use Instagram Stories to share behind-the-scenes shots, quick tips, or brand messages. Instagram stores can be up to 60 seconds long. And disappear after 24 hours. \nYou might also consider creating longer educational videos. This type of content may perform better on owned media channels. Such as your website or blog. \nIt's also a good choice for YouTube. Where the ideal video length is seven to 15 minutes.\n4. Plan the Video Production Process\nAsk yourself these questions during the planning stage:\nWhere will you shoot your video? \nWill you need video equipment? Or will you use your smartphone?\nWill you hire talent? \nWho will be responsible for video editing? \nAt this point, it\u2019s a good idea to assess your budget. Determine how much you can afford to spend. On video equipment, editing software, and other necessary resources. \nIf you\u2019re using your smartphone, which works well for social media videos, you may not need a budget at all. \nThere are also video creation tools that allow you to repurpose existing content into marketing videos. Without the need for equipment, video talent, or editing. \nConvert Articles to Videos\nIf you don\u2019t want or need a large-scale video shoot, turn your existing content into marketing videos instead. \nUse AI Video Marketing Automator to convert text into video content. Our tool also doubles as an AI script generator. Which can further free up your time.\nWhen you open the AI Video Marketing Automator app, you have three options:\nURL to Video: Use this feature to convert your blog posts into social videos. Or any other type of video content.\nAI Prompt: Enter a topic. Such as \"Video marketing statistics\" or \"How to take screenshots in Windows 10.\u201d And let AI write the script.\nBlank: Enter your script. Or create a video from scratch. \nLet's say you want to turn a blog post about superfoods into a video. \nSelect the first option, \"URL to Video.\"\nThe tool will open a pop-up window where you can enter the blog post URL. And the desired video type and length. \nYou\u2019ll get suggestions for the ideal video length. For each of the major social platforms.\nSelect the type of images you want to appear in the video. These can be stock photos, 3D illustrations, hand-drawn illustrations, or other visuals from Semrush's library.\nWhen you're done, click \"Create Video.\u201d And let the tool do its magic.\nAI Video Marketing Automator will extract the main ideas from your blog post. And turn them into a video script. It will add relevant images, voice-overs, and subtitles.\nCustomize the video by clicking the icons \"Voice,\" \"Style,\" \"Music,\" or \"Media\" on the left side of the screen.\nIf everything looks good, click \"Export Video\" on the upper-right side of the screen.\nAll you have left to do now is click \"Download Video.\u201d And post it on your website or other platforms.\nFurther reading: Top 10 Content Repurposing Tools\n5. Determine How You'll Measure Success\nLastly, decide how you\u2019re going to measure video performance. \nFor example, you can track the following:\nViews\nClicks\nLikes\nShares\nComments\nSignups \nConversions\nUse these insights to see what you did well. And where you can improve.\nHow to Make a Video for Your Business\nThe video production process has three stages:\nPre-production: In this stage, you'll plan out your content. And set up the studio. You may also need to book talent, purchase video equipment, and tackle the legal aspects. Like obtaining permits or licenses for shooting in public spaces.\nProduction: This is when you'll shoot the video. Your team will test equipment, adjust the lighting, and address the small details. Such as makeup and props.\nPost-production: The post-production process includes video editing, voice-over recording, and other relevant steps\nWe\u2019ve broken the video production process into smaller steps below. \nYou may be able to skip some steps. Depending on the type of video you\u2019re creating. \nConduct Keyword Research\nKeywords can make your videos more discoverable. On social media platforms. And in search engines. \nLet's say you want to make an explainer video about protein powder. \nUse Semrush's Keyword Magic Tool to check the Volume (how many searches this term gets on average per month). And Keyword Difficulty (KD). Which tells you how challenging it will be to rank for this term. \nYou\u2019ll also see related terms. Like \u201cvegan protein powder\u201d and \u201cbest protein powder for women.\u201d Which get fewer searches per month but have lower keyword difficulty scores. \nOnce you've decided on a target keyword, use it in these locations: \nVideo title\nVideo file name\nDescription\nTranscript\nTags\nIf you're going to post the video on your website, include the target keyword in the page URL.\nPrepare the Script\nVideo scripts have three primary components. \nIncluding:\nAction lines: Write a couple of sentences that describe the actions happening in a scene. (\"Go to your desk and unbox the laptop. Look at each component and explain its role.\")\nSluglines, or scene headings: These are brief directions that establish the setting of each scene. They usually specify the location. And time of the day. (\u201c3RD-FLOOR OFFICE\u2014DAY.\u201d)\nDialogue: This section makes up the bulk of your script. It includes the on-screen text, voice-overs, and the words spoken by the characters.\nYour script's length depends on how long the video is going to be.\nFor example, Lemonlight recommends writing a 60-word script for videos under 30 seconds.\nIf your video is 60 seconds long, aim for 120 words or so. A two-minute video may require a 240-word script.\nThese numbers are not set in stone. It all depends on speaking speed. \nOverall, your video script should be clear, concise, and relevant to the target audience. Read it aloud several times before shooting for best results. \nSet Up the Studio\nShooting high-quality videos requires specialized equipment. But you can also use your smartphone. Or AI Video Marketing Automator. \nFor example, it's not necessary to use a fancy camera to shoot a 30-second how-to video for TikTok. But if you want to make a brand video or product demo, it may be useful to have access to professional equipment.\nDepending on the type of video, you may need the following: \nVideo camera\nShotgun mic or lavaliers\nTripods\nBasic lighting equipment\nMemory cards\nAudio cables\nBatteries\nExternal hard drive\nIf your budget allows for it, you might also consider: \nCamera lenses\nHeadphones\nTeleprompter\nAudio recorder\nGimbal\nCapture cards\nSound-dampening devices\nLivestreaming monitors\nGet the Talent Ready\nTalent may or may not be necessary, depending on your budget. And the type of video you want to make.\nFor example, this video from Semrush Academy features an industry expert on the topic of leadership and people management: \nBut not all videos require on-screen talent. \nSay you want to shoot an explainer video about a specific software program. This might work well with a voiceover only. \nAlternatively, use AI Video Marketing Automator. Or AI voice generators.\nIf you shoot a more complex video, such as a short documentary about your brand, you'll need to prepare the talent. In some cases, it may make sense to hire professional actors.\nGive talent the script ahead of time. And be clear about the message you want to convey. Share audience demographics and preferences. So talent can use the right tone of voice. And language. \nShoot the Video\nThe big day is finally here.\nStart by checking equipment. To make sure everything works properly. Have the props ready, adjust the lighting, and position your camera at the appropriate angle and distance.\nYou'll also need to manually adjust the camera settings. Such as aperture, white balance, and shutter speed. Based on the lighting conditions. \nThis will ensure accurate color reproduction. And allow you to capture the subject clearly.\nFollow these tips to get the best shots: \nShoot multiple takes. Mistakes can happen, and it's easier to fix them later if you have multiple shots of the same scene.\nCapture a variety of shots, including wide shots, medium shots, and close-ups\nMaintain consistency in lighting, framing, and audio\nMake sure the subject is in sharp focus. Use focus tracking if the subject is moving.\nDiffuse or bounce the light to avoid harsh shadows\nFrame your shots based on the rule of thirds to achieve a better composition. With this technique, you\u2019ll visually break an image down into thirds, resulting in nine equal squares. After that, place your subject in the right or left third where the lines intersect.\nReview the recorded footage in real time to ensure it looks right\nHave some extra batteries, memory cards, audio cables, and other backup equipment on hand. In case of technical issues.\nCommunicate with your team at all times. Let them know if there's anything they should do differently, such as changing their tone of voice.\nEdit Your Video\nIf you make a video with AI Video Marketing Automator, it will be easy to edit. But you'll need specialized software to edit long or complex videos. Such as a documentary. Or company culture video.\nA popular video editing tool is Adobe Premiere Pro. It allows for multicam editing, 3D editing, and automatic captioning.\nMovavi is popular among YouTubers. And novice video editors. Due to its user-friendliness. It has features like motion tracking and noise removal.\nAnother option is Shotcut, a free, open-source video editor. Beginners will find it more challenging. But it works with 4K videos and covers all the bases.\nChoose the Music\nThe music you use depends on the target audience. And the message you want to convey.\nFor example, ambient background sounds can create a relaxed atmosphere suitable for home tour videos, some brand videos, or educational videos. \nUpbeat music may work better for promotional content. It creates a sense of energy and excitement.\nLike this short video on our YouTube channel:\nIf you\u2019re making social media videos, many platforms let you add music and sound effects for free. \nDepending on your budget and video type, you may want to use commercial songs. Or ask your creative team to produce the music.\nIf you use commercial songs, you may have to pay licensing fees. \nRegister on websites like the following to find the right music based on your needs and budget. \nEpidemic Sound\nYouTube Audio Library\nStoryblocks\nJamendo\nRecord the Voice-Over\nRecord the voice-over before, during, or after shooting the video. It's largely a matter of personal preference, as each approach has pros and cons.\nFor example, if you record the voice-over while filming, you may sound more natural. And save time on editing.\nThe problem is that any retakes on set may require additional voice-over recording. Additionally, syncing the voice-over with the visuals can be challenging.\nFollow these best practices:\nConduct a test recording beforehand. To figure out what works for you.\nPay attention to sound clarity and volume \nUse a friendly tone \nGet the pacing right\nSpeak clearly\nPlace the microphone about eight to 12 inches from your mouth\nChoose the Right Video Hosting Platforms\nNow it\u2019s time to choose a video host. \nOnline video platforms typically support the following files: \nMP4\nAVI\nMOV\nFLV\nWMV\nSome may also accept less common formats, such as ProRes or WebM. Check their requirements in advance. So you can choose the right format.\nHosting your videos on a third-party platform can make it easier to share them online. And reach your audience.\nBefore choosing a platform, consider your budget, type of videos, and target audience. You'll also want to look into features. And ease of use.\nFor example, some platforms are private. This makes them suitable for hosting videos you'll only share with your email subscribers, employees, or specific customers.\nHere are some video hosting options: \nYouTube\nYouTube is the second most popular website in the world after Google. \nWhat sets YouTube apart from other video hosting platforms is its reach. Plus, it's free to use.

And you have the freedom to make your own rules.\nThe most common types of owned media include:\nWebsites\nLanding pages\nBlogs\nEmail\nSharing videos on these channels can be a great way to diversify your content. And provide more value to your audience.\nFurther reading: What Owned Media Is and How to Master It in 6 Easy Steps\nPaid Channels\nPaid media involves paying Google, Facebook, or other third parties to promote your content. Paid channels are the platforms where your content will appear.\nThe biggest benefit of paid media is that it allows for more targeted marketing. \nFor example, companies can use paid advertising to target specific audience demographics. Such as 20- to 25-year-old men who live in Orlando, Florida, make at least $150,000 per year, and love photography.\nConsider using one or more of the following channels. Depending on your budget and goals:\nDisplay ads: This type of advertising allows you to promote your brand or products on third-party websites and apps. Incorporate videos into your ads. To make them engaging and spark curiosity.\nOut-stream video ads: These are mobile-only ads that appear within editorial content. For example, Forbes and other business websites may feature out-stream ads related to entrepreneurship. The videos play automatically. Putting your brand or products in front of potential customers.\nIn-stream video ads: These appear within other videos on online platforms. Like Facebook and YouTube. Viewers see them before, during, or after watching the main video. Depending on the platform. For example, YouTube may display a 30-second video ad before showing the video you clicked on.\nInterstitial video ads: Use these types of ads to display your videos on mobile apps. The ad will take up the full screen and grab viewers' attention.\nNative ads: These ads integrate seamlessly with the platform where they appear. They're relevant to the page content. And don't disrupt the viewer's experience. Think about the ads that appear in your Facebook feed. Or at the top of Google search results.\nSponsored content: Reach out to influencers, online newspapers, and media outlets that publish sponsored content. If you reach an agreement, they'll share your videos on their websites. Or social media pages. As a result, you may gain exposure and reach a wider audience.\nInfluencer marketing: Partner with influencers in your niche or industry to create video content together. Influencer marketing can help you expand your reach. And build credibility. \nMeasure Video Marketing Performance\nOnce your video is live, you'll want to see how it performs on different platforms. This will allow you to channel your efforts in the right direction.\nFirst, decide which metrics you want to track:\nView count: The total number of times a video has been viewed\nPlay rate: The percentage of people who clicked the play button\nEngagement rate: The number of clicks, likes, and shares your video got on social media\nClick-through rate (CTR): The percentage of views that resulted in a click\nVideo completion rate (VCR): The percentage of viewers who watched an entire video\nConversion rate: The percentage of customers who took the desired action, such as joining your email list after watching a video\nBounce rate: The percentage of people who leave a video without watching it in full\nTime on page: The amount of time someone stays on a webpage\nMost platforms feature built-in analytics tools that enable users to track these metrics. This includes Facebook Audience Insights, Twitter Analytics, YouTube Analytics, and more. \nPlus, there are third-party tools that consolidate all your data in one place.\nStart with Semrush's Social Tracker.\nThis tool allows you to monitor your competitors' social media accounts. And see how you measure against them. Learn the number of viewers who watch and interact with their videos.\nSocial Tracker also shows how many shares, reactions, and comments a video got over the past 60 days. Or 30 days for YouTube. Plus other useful stats. Such as subscriber growth rate and top-performing content.\nThere\u2019s also a Social Analytics tool that can track video performance. On LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram. Users can monitor the number of new followers, profile interactions, audience engagement, and other metrics.\nCreating a social media video marketing strategy will help you drive brand awareness, engagement, and sales.\nHere are some tips to keep in mind.\nLeverage Visuals \nAs many as 83% of people watch videos with the sound off. This percentage is even higher among mobile users (92%).\nUse strong visuals, captions, and subtitles to get your point across. Integrate your company\u2019s colors, logos, and other visual elements. To help make your brand memorable. \nWatch your videos before sharing them on social media. To ensure they\u2019re engaging and your message is clear. \nTasty, a food network company, creates recipe videos you can watch. With or without sound. They use bold text overlays and captions to highlight essential details. \nUse Short Videos to Drive Engagement\nShort-form video content tends to perform better on social media than longer videos.\nFor example, Instagram Reels get more likes than other types of content on the platform. \nIn general, short-form video content is under 60 seconds long. And works for sharing quick tips, makeup tutorials, product teasers, or cooking hacks.\nThis type of content can complement longer videos. Giving viewers a taste of your brand.\nFor instance, create a 30-minute video on starting a business. And a short 60-second video summarizing its key takeaways.\nHook Viewers \nIn one survey, about 50% of TikTok users said videos longer than 60 seconds are stressful. Approximately one-third reported watching online videos at double speed.\nStart your videos with an interesting fact, a breaking news story, bold visuals, or other attention-grabbing elements. Get to the point quickly. To keep viewers\u2019 interest. \nLike our video on the most popular search terms. It starts out with unexpected visuals. And a high-energy host. \nOptimize Videos for Different Screen Sizes\nTo ensure your videos look good on any device, check the requirements of each social media platform.\nFor example, if you plan to share content on Instagram, use the following:\n16:9 aspect ratio for landscape videos\n4:5 for portrait feed videos\n1:1 for square videos.\nTikTok recommends filming your video in portrait (9:16). So it fits any screen size.\nDecide which platforms you want to focus on. And then resize your videos accordingly.\nOne aspect to consider in the video pre-production process is where you're going to share your content.\nFacebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media channels all have distinct requirements. By adapting your content to each platform, you can grow your reach. And improve the viewer experience.\nInstagram Video Best Practices\nKeep your videos around 60 seconds for Stories, 90 seconds for Reels, and up to four hours for livestreams. Instagram Feed Video Posts can be three seconds to 60 minutes long.\nShoot vertical videos in HD for Instagram Reels. Optimize them with hashtags, product tags, and captions that include your target keywords.\nUse MP4 or MOV for feed videos, Reels, and Stories. These shouldn't exceed 4GB.\nKeep the caption under 2,200 characters for Reels and in-feed videos. And 125 characters for Stories.\nCheck Instagram\u2019s Explore page. Incorporate the latest trends into your content. If possible, use a trending audio track to gain more exposure on the platform.\nRespond quickly to comments, direct messages, and videos that mention your brand\nFurther reading: 6 Instagram SEO Tips to Increase Your Reach\nFacebook Video Best Practices\nEnsure your videos have the highest possible resolution. And can keep viewers hooked for at least 60 seconds.\nUse an aspect ratio of 16:9 to 9:16 for Facebook feed, in-stream, and Marketplace videos. And 1.91:1 to 9:16 for Facebook Stories.\nStick to 240 seconds for in-feed and Marketplace videos. Five to 120 seconds for in-stream videos. And one to 120 seconds for Stories.\nPost new videos at least once a week to build your audience\nRefrain from explicitly asking viewers to like, share, or tag your content. Foster a sense of community. By encouraging them to share their opinions, leave feedback, or ask questions about the video.\nTease upcoming content to build anticipation and engagement. For example, say something like, \"Stay tuned for our next video, where we'll tell you more about [insert topic].\"\nLeverage Facebook's Watch Parties, polls, livestreaming, and other interactive features. These elements can help you build engagement. Without explicitly asking for likes or shares.\nIf your video marketing campaigns revolve around Facebook, upload your videos directly to the platform rather than linking to YouTube. You can post the same video on both platforms, but upload it to one channel at a time.\nYouTube and Facebook are competitors, and their ranking algorithms tend to prioritize native videos. This type of content often gets more exposure and engagement than non-native videos.\nImage Source: Facebook\nX (Twitter) Video Best Practices\nKeep your videos under two minutes and 20 seconds. X favors short messages, whether in written or video form. The ideal video length is around 15 seconds.\nAdd strong visuals to reinforce your message. And keep viewers hooked.\nShowcase your business or products within the first three seconds to improve brand recall\nAim for an aspect ratio of 16:9 or 1:1 to make sure your videos display in full\nUse the Media Studio. To create compelling video titles, descriptions, links, and interactive elements for your videos.\nAdd captions to reach a wider audience. Including people who are hard of hearing or deaf. And those watching your videos on mute.\nInclude no more than two hashtags per tweet. These should summarize your message and incorporate relevant keywords (e.g., #ketobrownies or #homeimprovement). Adding too many hashtags can make your post look spammy.\nImage Source: Twitter\nLinkedIn Video Best Practices\nLinkedIn videos can be anywhere between 75KB and 5GB. Keep them under 10 minutes if you upload them via the LinkedIn mobile app. Or under 15 minutes if you upload them via the LinkedIn website.\nChoose the ideal video length based on your goals. LinkedIn recommends using short, 30-second videos for brand awareness. And longer videos for demand generation.\nAim for an aspect ratio of 1:2.4 to 2.4: and a resolution of 256x144 to 4096x2304. To make sure your videos look great on any device.\nUpload your content directly to the platform. Remember that LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, and other social media channels favor native videos.\nAdd supporting copy and hashtags to your videos. For best results, keep your copy under 150 characters.\nCreate and share videos aimed at business professionals. These could be industry news, behind-the-scenes shots, product updates, or insider coverage of relevant events. You can also spotlight inspiring employees.\nImage Source: LinkedIn\nTikTok Video Best Practices\nThe videos you create on TikTok cannot exceed 60 seconds. But if you upload a video from your computer or smartphone, it can be up to three minutes long. TikTok Stories can last up to 15 seconds.\nShare high-resolution videos (720p or higher) in portrait mode. Use sound to enhance their appeal on the platform.\nBuild your narrative around the latest trends on TikTok. About 77% of users say they prefer brand content featuring trends, memes, or challenges.\nStrike a balance between promotional and educational content. Most users turn to TikTok for entertainment. You risk losing their interest if your videos are too sales-oriented.\nIf you plan to use TikTok video ads, update them at least once a week. When consumers see the same ad over and over again, they may become bored and disengaged.\nTikTok features auto-generated captions, creator captions, and text-to-speech. Leverage these features to make your video content accessible to everyone.\nAdd hashtags like #ad, #promotion, or #sponsored when promoting products or services in your videos. The Federal Trade Commission requires advertisers and influencers to disclose any relationships they have with a brand.\nImage Source: Tik Tok\nFurther reading: The Hooks of Viral TikToks\nPinterest Video Best Practices\nPinterest videos can be up to 15 minutes long. However, the platform recommends keeping your video ads between six and 15 seconds for maximum impact.\nCraft video titles of up to 100 characters. And descriptions of no more than 500 characters.\nUse eye-catching cover images for video pins and add captions. These elements can help users who watch your videos without sound get a better understanding of the content.\nMake your brand or product the focal point of the video. Add your brand colors, fonts, logo, and text overlays to every video pin.\nShare videos that encourage some sort of action. Whether it's buying a product, trying a hack, or starting a project.\nConsider repurposing your Instagram Stories, Reels, and TikTok content into video pins. This type of content is short, catchy, and actionable. Which makes it ideal for Pinterest.\nOrganize your video pins by topic or category. And publish them on relevant boards.\nImage Source: Pinterest\nLive Video Best Practices \nConsider using Switchboard Live, StreamYard, Wirecast, or BoxCast to stream to multiple platforms at once. These apps also include video editing tools, video player embedding, screen sharing, and other features that can streamline your work.\nLet your followers know about upcoming livestreams. Promote the video in advance to build excitement and increase viewership.\nTeam up with an influencer or industry expert to host the live broadcast. This would allow you to leverage their audience to promote your brand or products.\nEncourage viewers to engage with your video. Encourage them to ask questions. Or share their thoughts in the comments section. \nWhile live videos rely on spontaneity, you should still have a plan. Draft a brief outline that highlights your key points, goals, and CTAs. And let it guide your stream. Think of it as a road map rather than a script.\nDouble-check equipment before going live. Test your mic, lighting, and camera to make sure everything works as expected.\nSave your live videos to repurpose them later on. For example, you could add captions, background music, and graphics. And then share them on social media.\nUnlock the Power of Video Marketing\nVideo marketing is an asset to any brand. Whether you use AI Video Marketing Automator to turn your blog posts into videos. Or create a large-scale production. \nHelp your videos reach a wider audience by targeting keywords with Keyword Magic Tool. And track essential metrics. Like shares and plays. To ensure your videos resonate with your audience."

    "text": "Have you ever discovered a new spot and immediately wanted to tell all your friends about it\u2026 but also selfishly gatekeep it for yourself? That\u2019s how I feel about St\u00e4lle Studios, a skincare oasis hidden away on the edge of Soho with esthetician Elizabeth Grace Hand at the helm. Its allure is not just the calming environment or the customized approach to every facial but also the sense of connection and attention that is often hard to find in today's fast-paced beauty world. \nI was first introduced to Hand five years ago. My roommate booked a Dr. Barbara Sturm facial during the brand\u2019s pop-up at the Bowery Hotel and got Hand as her esthetician. For weeks after, she sang her praises. Once I finally met her for myself a few years later, I immediately understood what my roommate had been talking about all this time. Hand is beauty obsessed, extremely knowledgeable, and understands precisely the right points to hit during a facial to make you leave thinking, \u201cDamn, I really do look good.\u201d More importantly, she doesn\u2019t take the whole process too seriously. She is relatable and funny, which is why most of her clients end up wanting her as a best friend after their first appointment (or maybe that\u2019s just me). \nWhat started as a business run out of her one-bedroom apartment has become one of New York's most coveted beauty havens. Her appointment book fills up quickly, and her shelves are full of Augustinus Bader, Bioeffect, Furtuna Skin, and more luxurious goodies she has curated to perfection. During our interview, one of her clients stopped in for an emergency product refill\u2014even more proof of the kind of community she has built for herself. \nBelow, the talented founder shares her beauty journey, the massage technique she alone provides in New York City, and the backstory behind creating what we now know and love as St\u00e4lle Studios. \nCoveteur: What was your relationship with beauty growing up? Have you always been beauty-obsessed, or is that something that came to you later in life?\nElizabeth Grace Hand: \u201cI was always the girliest girl. I had all the Barbies and American Girl Dolls\u2014as girly as they get. My mom was always into beauty. I remember when I started getting breakouts, she took me to the dermatologist. At 13, I was getting chemical peels and dermabrasion at a med spa in North Carolina because my acne was so bad. \nBefore that, I remember a big bonding part of my childhood was when my mom, my sister, and I would go to the closest Sephora in Chapel Hill and spend hours adding everything to our basket. This was the era of Pink Sugar perfume and Urban Decay edible glitter. So I\u2019ve been obsessed with beauty for a long time; makeup first but then skincare as a necessity.\u201d \nWhat made you want to become an esthetician? What was your career trajectory before that? \nEGH: \u201cI graduated high school in 2008 when beauty was not real. There wasn\u2019t much high-end skincare when you would get a facial. Treatments were more [something you got] for your birthday to relax or when I went to get extractions for my acne. You weren't leaving with an at-home routine. \nAlthough I loved beauty, I never thought that it could be a career path. I also loved fashion, though, so I started working in retail at a clothing store and eventually decided to go to fashion camp at FIT in the summers. I ended up going to college and studying textiles at NC State. Then I decided I needed to be in New York, so I went to FIT and graduated with a major in fashion merchandising management. From there, I worked in fashion sales and retail, which came easy to me, but I didn\u2019t love working wholesale, lugging clothing racks, and doing trade shows. \nAround that time, I became obsessed with K-beauty and the Glow Recipe website\u2014before they had their own brand\u2014and Glossier. It was about 2014 when I knew I wanted to make the shift into beauty. I had no experience, but I kept applying and applying. I even went to the Glossier offices to hand-deliver my resume, but I never heard anything. I ended up getting a job at L\u2019Oreal working for Dermablend. I enrolled in esthetician school, and they let me work part-time while I was in school full-time. \nWhile I was in school, I was doing everything I could to meet people in the industry. SpaceNK did this event where you could preview their brands\u2019 new launches, and [that\u2019s how I met] Dr. Barbara Sturm. When I finished school, I started working for them. As an esthetician, I could do facial events, but with my sales experience, I was also a rep. I was the girl who went to the stores. When the spa opened, I did a combo of both jobs, but then Covid happened, and I was furloughed in July 2020. I told a friend who owned the med spa JECT and she asked me to help her on the side. That\u2019s how I ended up developing the JECT facial program. I started doing facials there, and when Sturm\u2019s spas reopened, I just did both.\u201d \nWhat made you want to create your own space?\nEGH: \u201cIt happened as an accident, actually; the best things do. Sturm\u2019s New York Spa pop-up ended, and while they were looking for a new location, I was helping them with virtual consultations again. But meanwhile, all my clients needed facials, people who would come every month. I knew they would go somewhere else [if they couldn\u2019t come to me], so I initially had them come to my one-bedroom apartment. It got to be so busy so quick. I would tell my partner John to leave from 10 to 7 so clients could come. It was the first time I was really making money. I obviously needed to find a space and found a landlord that was flexible. He let me commit to three months, so if it didn\u2019t work out, it was fine. I\u2019ve been looking for a new space recently. We\u2019ve outgrown this, and now I have three people working for me.\u201d\nWhat does St\u00e4lle mean? \nEGH: \u201cIt\u2019s short for a Swedish word: smultronst\u00e4lle. My partner is Swedish, and I'm part Swedish. There isn't a word for it in English, but the figurative meaning is a place that you go to relax and de-stress. A place you go to escape all of the pressures and stress of the world and your life. I thought it was such a beautiful word. That's what I want St\u00e4lle to be\u2014a place you go to relax and feel good. [My studio] is my smultronst\u00e4lle. \nI had this name before I found my studio space. The weirdest part is that the literal meaning of smultronst\u00e4lle is a strawberry patch. In Sweden, they have these little patches that grow mini strawberries. [In my current studio], there is a terrace on my floor, and a man grows mini strawberries. How crazy is that?\u201d \nCan you tell me the origin story of St\u00e4lle Angels [a recurring client feature on the St\u00e4lle Studios Instagram]? \nEGH: \u201cIt just came to me. There really isn\u2019t a story. I have always loved the Fiorucci Angels. I said \u201cSt\u00e4lle Angel\u201d and it just kind of stuck. I think I was making an Instagram caption and it clicked in my head.\u201d\nTo know you is to appreciate your eye for curation, from your apartment to your wardrobe, and obviously your products. How do you curate the products and treatments you incorporate into your studio? \nEGH: \u201cAt this point, I have so many clients I've been seeing for years and years. Now that I have my own studio, people are sending me things all the time, so I try everything. I'm also on the Violet Grey Creation Committee, so I get to try products that have yet to be released. Obviously, I try it on myself first to see how I like it. From there, I will test it on clients I've been seeing forever. \nThe last brand I tested with my clients was Retrouv\u00e9. My client Jess, who I have known for years, left my studio and got stopped three times about her skin. I had put the Retrouv\u00e9 Intensive Moisturizer on her and I was like, okay, we need to carry that. \nI've worked at other places, and a lot of times, you go to book a facial, and there are a bunch of different options. [Oftentimes] you don't know what you're supposed to choose. It's confusing. So, when I started my studio, I wanted to develop one facial and make it custom. Technically, I have three facials, but they are all custom. 99% of the time, someone is just booking the signature facial, and then I'll tell them what they need down to the cleanser and the massage. So, depending on what their skin needs from when I look at them, I can decide if they need more of a lymphatic treatment or if we're going to do a deeper tissue massage.\u201d \nSpeaking of massage, you are currently the only trained esthetician in New York City to use the Kagan method. Tell me more about that. What is so special about this method and how do you incorporate it into your facials?\nEGH: \u201cKagan is the best thing I have found for depuffing. [The method] brings in the chest and the back. My clients will be laying on a plastic sheet so that my hands can get under your back. Just from touching the d\u00e9collet\u00e9, neck, and back, you will leave here depuffed. \nThe woman who started it, Natalya Fuji, has been working for years and years [to develop this practice]. It\u2019s a combination of Thai, European, and Japanese techniques. She took all the best parts and created this amazing massage. I found out about it through an aesthetician friend of mine. We talk about what the next cool thing is. There are only 20 of us practicing this in the US. \nIf someone comes in and they have a smaller face and there's not much to depuff, I wouldn't even do this on them. It would be too active on them. But if someone comes in and says depuff, this is what they need, this is what I am doing. One thing with Kagan that's cool, too, is that it's a ritual. I tell people not to talk during it and just relax. Because you're releasing tension, there's a lot of stuff built up in there, and you're releasing and opening it up. Some people will cry.\u201d \nHow has the experience of being on the Violet Grey Curation Committee been like for you? \nEGH: \u201cIt\u2019s so fun! Sarah Brown, the director, is an icon in the business. She was the Vogue beauty director. She knows her stuff and has amazing taste. If Sarah Brown likes something, it's good, you know? It goes through her before it even touches us. Everything that's sent to us is good and it's up to us to kind of figure out what we really love about it. Obviously I love getting really good products sent to me, but I also love seeing trends. So I get to see what brands are coming out with before they're anything.\u201d \nSocial media is such a touchpoint for introduction for so many people. Did you have to come up with your own social media strategy for St\u00e4lle? \nEGH: \u201cMy social media is literally just what I'm feeling. I don't do a whole lot of education on there [yet], but I would love to do more, and that is the goal eventually. It's just the fact that I'm doing everything for the studio. Luckily, I'm not the cleaning lady anymore, but I'm so overwhelmed with everything. I'm booked already without even doing anything on social media.\nI've made my Instagram more of an aesthetic just because I only have the bandwidth for that. It doesn't take too much time for me, and it\u2019s something that isn\u2019t forced. If you go to my Instagram and really look, I'm not teaching anybody anything. It's just pretty beige photos. I always joke that if pimples were beige, I would have an acne account [laughs] but because they're red, I don't ever post it. Right now, [my Instagram is mostly] the Angels. It's the glowy, dewy girl. I could be doing more, and that's on the list for the future.\u201d\nWhat are your thoughts on non-experts sharing skincare advice on social media? \nEGH: \u201cA big part of my job is just helping people cut through what's real and what's not. I think that [social media] adds to it. I also think it's nice that there is a lot of information out there because, again, when I was younger, going to Sephora, I had to drive 45 minutes to find anything cool. It's really great that people are giving information, but you should always take it with a grain of salt. It\u2019s important if you're the consumer of this content to do research on your own and not just listen. I would say almost every day, someone is texting me, and I tell them, \u2018No more buying TikTok things. Text me [first].\u201d My clients have me; not everybody does.\u201d"

    "text": "Remember the concept of monthly or weekly allowances? Depending on your household, you were either given an allowance for doing household chores or, if you were lucky, your parents gave you an allowance just because. Whether that money was your spending money or stowed away safely in your piggy bank, allowances are many children\u2019s first taste of financial independence. \nResearch found that in households that do give allowances, most kids and teens (ages 5-19) receive an average of $11 weekly. However, in the Pippen household, Larsa Pippen revealed that she gives her 15-year-old daughter, Sophia, $2,500 a month to cover her personal expenses. \nMost young people between ages 5 and 19 receive an average of $11 weekly. \n\u201cYou guys understand, like, L.A. is super expensive,\u201d she said, per People magazine. \u201cSo after school, [Sophia] orders food or Uber or buys presents for her friends\u2019 birthdays.\u201d\nNow, considering the financial reality for most families in the United States, a $2,500 monthly allowance may not be feasible for the average person. However, the seemingly dying art of giving children allowances could be something worth considering when raising kids today: \nBenefits a child\u2019s financial literacy\nAs previously reported by theGrio, financial experts say the age-old technique of giving children an allowance is a gateway to teaching them about money. One of the keys to building generational wealth and healthy financial habits is through candid discussion. Allowance systems, whether earned through household chores or good grades, introduce children to the basics of money management. In addition to opening the doors for financial conversations and lessons, allowances give children hands-on experiences dealing with money without the high stakes seen in the real world. This ultimately allows children to get comfortable with money at an early age and grow a deeper understanding of finances as they get older. \nIf you\u2019re unsure of how much to give in allowances, experts advise starting off by giving $1 to $2 for each year of their age. For example, a 7-year-old would receive $7.00, etc. \nRecommended Stories\nFosters a sense of independence\nAdditionally, offering an allowance dismantles the \u201cmoney grows on trees\u201d attitude some children tend to possess. Kids are always asking their parents to buy them something new, whether it\u2019s a toy, a video game, shoes, etc. However, now, in addition to inflated prices, kids are finding interest in more expensive, trendy items like Stanley cups and luxury skincare brands because they are seeing their favorite influencers use them. \nBy implementing an allowance system, parents can easily teach their children how to budget and spend responsibly despite the growing trends of consumerism. The set amount and scheduled distribution of funds inherently puts kids on budget and allows them to see how and where their money goes when shopping. \nNever miss a beat: Get our daily stories straight to your inbox with theGrio\u2019s newsletter."

    "text": "Pinterest is a self-described visual discovery engine. It\u2019s where you might go to find an idea for a fresh new recipe, save an easy-to-follow morning workout routine or watch a quick demo of someone\u2019s skincare routine \u2014 think of an endless feed of vertical images and short videos you can view and save to spark inspiration. \nWith hundreds of millions of monthly users, Pinterest has also become an organic advertising tool for bloggers and business owners, and a way for popular pinners to partner with brands and cash in on influential posts.\nHow to make money on Pinterest\nMaybe Pinterest can be part of your side hustle. Here are a few ways to make money with Pinterest. \n1. Free advertising for your blog\nLet\u2019s say you have a popular blog you\u2019ve been able to monetize, such as by integrating online ads or embedding affiliate links for products relevant to your niche. You can use Pinterest to promote your blog posts in an effort to drive traffic to your website. \nGrab an image from your blog or site and use Pinterest\u2019s built-in tools to add text and tweak the design of your pin. Most importantly, add a link to the post to drive viewers back to your site or specific blog. The link will prominently show (and become clickable) when viewers hover over your pin. Success isn\u2019t guaranteed, but it\u2019s free to create a Pinterest account and post pins.\nBlog link example: Cooking with air fryers has become a time-saving way to make good food at home. One pin we spotted at the time of this writing featured a delectable image of a cheesy sandwich with the words \u201cAir Fryer Grilled Cheese\u201d added in an eye-catching font. The pin included a link to a detailed blog post on how to make the sandwich. \n2. Free advertising for your online business\nE-commerce business owners can try the organic advertising approach too. In the same way, you would make pins about your business offering, whether it's a product or online service, and link back to pages on your business website. \nOnline business link example: A pinner we ran across at the time of this writing used Pinterest posts to drive traffic to a website that offers online painting classes. One pin featured an image of a colorful flower painting with a link to a business site where people could purchase a watercolor painting tutorial. \n3. Affiliate marketing on Pinterest \nMaybe you started pinning as a fun way to share and engage with others on something you\u2019re passionate about, like cooking, fitness or collecting sneakers. Through consistent posts and demonstrated expertise in your niche, you\u2019ve amassed a following on Pinterest (and likely other social media platforms, too). Your influence could open opportunities to join an affiliate program, where you can earn a commission for promoting products featured in pins. \nOnce you\u2019re an affiliate, you can use the product tagging feature of Pinterest to add personalized affiliate links to pins. Then, viewers can click directly to product pages outside of Pinterest and make purchases, and you can earn a commission. Some affiliate programs let you feature a full product collection in one place. (Take note that you\u2019re required to disclose your partnership with a brand using a feature in the app.) \nAffiliate marketing example: Some fashion and beauty creators pin outfit ideas and link directly to a site that lets interested viewers shop specific \u201clooks.\u201d One affiliate site is called LTK and it connects creators with brands and facilitates commissions for sales. Other popular programs that let you earn a commission for recommending products on social accounts include Amazon Associates and ShareASale.\n4. Frugal or entrepreneurial inspiration \nPinterest probably wasn\u2019t started with brand deals and affiliate marketing in mind. It\u2019s first and foremost a digital bulletin board that allows for the broad exchange of ideas. You can use the platform to identify ways to save money. Make Pinterest your first stop when searching for DIY ways to improve your living space. \nDIY inspo example: Maybe you can save thousands on a basement remodel by painting the rafters and wall panels instead of paying a contractor to hang drywall. There\u2019s probably a Pinterest pin to serve up some visual ideas and ways to save. If you want to start an online business, search Pinterest for the best things to sell online as part of the research process. \nDo you get paid on Pinterest?\nPinterest doesn\u2019t pay content creators directly. Primary ways to make money with Pinterest involve using the platform as a marketing or influencer tool, where earnings come through outside sources like your own business, an affiliate program or a brand you work with. \nHow many Pinterest followers do you need to get paid?\nThe self-advertising and influencer marketing methods described above may not be particularly fruitful without at least a few thousand followers. But you can build your following over time through consistent, quality pins that are worth saving. (The Pinterest website stresses the importance of encouraging saves to grow your audience.) \nIf you\u2019re new to Pinterest, start pinning and see where it takes you. Try these tips to get started:\nConvert to a Pinterest business account. You can sign up for or convert your Pinterest personal account to a free business account for access to analytics and the ability for advertisers and merchants to create various ads on the platform. \nPay attention to trends. You can use the built-in Pinterest Trends tool to explore popular search terms, then craft pin titles, tags and description text that hits on relevant keywords. \nStudy how others do it. Find inspirational pinners in your area of interest and do a deep dive to study their monetizing ways. Click through pins, study imagery and design techniques and explore destination links to take cues from successful strategies."

    "text": "Irish consumers were spending \u20ac2.6 billion on hair and beauty treatments before the Covid pandemic upended the sector, according to a report commissioned by the Hair and Beauty Industry Confederation of Ireland. Close to half of that was on hair, skin and cosmetic products with the balance on the services of hairdressers and beauty therapists.\nThose in the industry will tell you that the pandemic has since led a ramp-up in beauty spending, in particular on skincare, as consumers with ample time at home to develop beauty routines were confronted with their own faces on regular Zoom calls.\nCovid also brought radical changes to the Irish retail landscape in terms of how we shop. The world of online beauty retail is now a booming sector, and those in the beauty business are investing heavily in their online offerings.\nA report by consulting firm McKinsey and Company, which puts the value of the global beauty market at $430 billion (\u20ac393.2 billion), says the value of ecommerce in beauty nearly quadrupled between 2015 and 2022. And it is expected to grow by 12 per cent annually out to 2027 (twice as fast as the 6 per cent growth predicted for the overall industry).\nJoann Mahon is founder and managing director of Millies.ie, one of the biggest Irish-owned online beauty sites, which specialises in premium and salon-quality brands.\nJoann Mahon, founder and managing director of Millies.ie: 'Covid hit but it had a really strong and positive effect for us.' \nMahon first set up a website in 2013 to promote her small salon business in Kildare but over the years the online side of her business has overtaken everything else, in particular since the pandemic. Accounts for Millies Beauty Limited show that the company made a profit of \u20ac450,451 in 2019. By the end of 2022, that had more than doubled to \u20ac942,491.\n\u201cMaybe five years ago is really when I gave my attention to the online space,\u201d Mahon tells The Irish Times. At the time, her salon business was consistently operating at almost full capacity and the only real avenue for growth was through online sale of beauty products.\n\u201cI invested more in a warehouse, a new warehouse system and a management team that actually could build that side of the business. We spent a good two years really perfecting that. Then, unfortunately, Covid hit but it had a really strong and positive effect for us,\u201d she said.\nMillies saw a \u201ccompletely different scale of growth\u201d during the pandemic, with revenues tripling and staff numbers doubling to about 50 to cater to demand. There were just under four million visitors to the site last year.\nMahon said younger Gen Z shoppers are driving growth across most categories but she said the business has also seen surprising growth among customers aged over 45, who have taken to shopping more online since the pandemic.\nWith the expansion of the online consumer market, Mahon said the space has become increasingly competitive, with big UK players entering the Irish market, bringing with them aggressive pricing and marketing.\n\u201cIn the Irish landscape, it\u2019s very, very competitive with UK players \u2013 Lookfantastic, for example. They\u2019re absolutely global, they\u2019re giants. They\u2019re value driven, they\u2019re very focused on the Irish market, and they\u2019re very aggressive on their spend for ads. It can be a big challenge to compete in that space with the biggest online retailers,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI definitely feel the bigger players are so aggressive in the space for a reason. It\u2019s a growing market, it absolutely is,\u201d she added.\nAs ecommerce beauty retailers are raising competition and cutting prices in the online space, department store beauty halls have had to adapt to hold on to custom from shoppers who now expect an \u201comnichannel\u201d experience \u2013 being able to browse products online or in-store interchangeably.\nTriona McGinley, beauty director at Brown Thomas Arnotts, says that about 20 per cent of sales across the two department store brands now happen online. She also references a \u201cspike\u201d since the pandemic.\n[ Ireland\u2019s influencer entrepreneurs: \u2018I was getting up at half five, working alone. Now it\u2019s a new world\u2019 ]\nThe group reported total turnover of \u20ac319.3 million last year, with accounts noting increased investment in its digital offering. Earlier this year, chief executive Donald McDonald said Brown Thomas Arnotts\u2019 digital business is now trading at three times the level it was in 2019.\nMcGinley says a \u201chuge proportion\u201d of their customers now shop on multiple channels. And when shoppers embrace both online and in-store shopping, their \u201cspending increases significantly\u201d, she says.\n\u201cOmnichannel is a 360-degree approach to what the customer is looking for, and when you have a customer who\u2019s omnichannel, they\u2019re more likely to shop more often,\u201d she said.\nMcGinley said Brown Thomas Arnotts has put a lot of strategic investment into both its website, which originally launched in 2013, and its recently launched app \u2013 with the group seeing 33 million visitors across both platforms last year.\nTriona McGinley, beauty director at Brown Thomas Arnotts: 'Planet Beauty has been so important to us because it makes sure that we are the destination, whether it\u2019s online or in stores.' Photograph: Nick Bradshaw \n\u201cOnline is very important, it is your shop window. Our phones have become shop windows as well when people are scrolling on the app. It took a lot of investment to make [them] customer centric,\u201d she said.\nMcGinley is speaking in the group\u2019s Planet Beauty store on Clarendon Street, a separate building to the neighbouring Brown Thomas beauty hall on Grafton Street. First launched two years ago in Dundrum, the Planet Beauty concept is a direct result of the rapidly changing demands of online beauty trends, and how \u201conline-first\u201d customers like to shop.\nRather than traditional beauty hall concession stands of legacy brands, Planet Beauty shelves are stocked with up-and-coming Irish brands and selected trending products that can be quickly swapped around to reflect what is going viral online.\n\u201cOne of the main reasons behind Planet Beauty was to have the ability to on-trend and off-trend. It\u2019s where we can quickly turn on and deliver products to our customers who have been suddenly sparked by waves of TikTok content and influencer endorsements,\u201d she said, adding that her buying team are \u201calways on\u201d to try to get ahead of the latest trends.\nMcGinley said the store caters to typically younger \u201cdigital native\u201d customers who come into stores \u201carmed with screenshots of viral products they discovered online\u201d.\n\u201cThat younger generation, they just know exactly what they\u2019re looking for, and they might go straight to online to purchase it, or they might have heard about something and just want a little bit more education in store. Planet Beauty has been so important to us because it makes sure that we are the destination, whether it\u2019s online or in stores,\u201d she said.\nThe pharmacy sector is also embracing the omnichannel approach to selling beauty products. Oonagh O\u2019Hagan, founder and managing director of Meaghers Pharmacy Group, says that anywhere up to 40 per cent of their total sales can come from selling beauty products online.\n\u201cWhen it comes to online beauty, it could be 20 to 25 per cent [of business], but at certain seasonal times, or if we put a big focus on a particular online campaign, it could go as high as 30 or 40 per cent,\u201d she said.\nO\u2019Hagan bought her first Baggot Street pharmacy in 2001 and now operates 10 pharmacies across Dublin as well as their online platform, with total annual turnover of about \u20ac30 million.\nIn 2022 when the overall pharmacy group reported a turnover of \u20ac22.64 million and a profit for the year of \u20ac40,177, its subsidiary Meagher\u2019s Pharmacy Online Sales Limited recorded a profit of \u20ac585,525.\nMeaghers first ventured into the online world in 2014 when it launched a click-and-collect option from pharmacies. After only a few months this evolved to a fully transactional online store.\nO\u2019Hagan says they saw online business triple during the pandemic when they moved all non-essential retail to their website, and they had to double the size of their warehouse to cater to demand.\nOonagh O\u2019Hagan, owner of Meagher\u2019s Pharmacy chain: 'The online business enabled us to look after customers the length and breadth of Ireland without having a physical presence there.' Photograph: Dara Mac D\u00f3naill \n\u201cOur online sales absolutely blew through the roof. It was the right thing to do at the time, but it was a logistical nightmare. It was a real challenge to keep everyone safe in the warehouse, and we were pretty much going through the night to get our orders out safely,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m really so glad that we did do that, because it was the right thing to do for our customers and for our teams, and it really allowed us to test the water as well with online to see what opportunity there was out there,\u201d she added.\nO\u2019Hagan says the online store has been a means to vastly expand the business\u2019s customer base without having to invest in bricks and mortar.\n\u201cWe are Dublin based, but what the online business has enabled us to do is to look after customers the length and breadth of Ireland without having a physical presence there. And now we\u2019re shipping to 70 different countries all over the world,\u201d she said, noting she has repeat customers everywhere from San Francisco to Abu Dhabi.\nHowever, there can be dangers associated with beauty products sold online, O\u2019Hagan notes, particularly when teens and even younger children can access products not suitable for them.\n\u201cWe see so many young girls from the age of 10 or even younger choosing products that have active ingredients, acids and retinoids in them, because they\u2019re hot on TikTok,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining their skin barrier and they\u2019re causing chemical burns.\u201d Companies that operate online only might not see the customer coming in with the burns, she says, \u201cbut we have the mums coming in to us saying little Mary bought this product, can you do something to help her\u201d.\n[ Sculpted boss Aimee Connolly: \u2018I have been surrounded by girl power for as long as I know\u2019 ]\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important for us as a pharmacy brand to be cognisant of the trends that are on platforms like TikTok, which are just not correct. At the end of the day, yes we\u2019re in retail, but we have a responsibility as a pharmacy business to be a voice in all of that and make sure that we have responsible selling as well,\u201d she added.\nWhile the forced move to the online world during the pandemic led to that initial boost for Meaghers\u2019 online beauty offering, O\u2019Hagan says they are continually investing in that side of the business to retain those shoppers, including rolling out same-day delivery in Dublin recently.\nEveryone we spoke to cited AI and augmented reality as key focuses for future investment and innovation, and Meaghers is no different. O\u2019Hagan said AI has the potential to help improve the experience of shopping for beauty products online, and tackle the shortfalls of not being able to test products in person or get more information from staff.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one negative, I suppose, with online. For example, how do you know what colour to use when it comes to your foundation?\u201d she said, adding that brands are already using AI to provide colour matching and other services.\nMeaghers currently uses AI as part of its online customer service and is testing out other platforms to help replicate the in-store experience, O\u2019Hagan says.\n\u201cI think absolutely [online beauty retail] will continue to grow and I think the brands that will really get this right are the brands that start to think about how you solve the problems of online; they\u2019re the brands to watch for sure,\u201d she said.\nSign up for Business push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone\nFind The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date\nOur Inside Business podcast is published weekly \u2013 Find the latest episode here"

    "text": "Renowned luxury hotel chain Evok collection sees strategic investment from the Courtin Family, who also owns beauty brand Clarins, in an effort to \u201ccreate unique experiences focused on well-being\u201d.\nThe Courtin Family \nThe Courtin family goes from beauty to luxury hotels as they make a bid towards a new high-stake investment, leading to an acquisition. The Courtin family\u2019s investment company, Famille C Participations, has invested \u20ac130 million (approximately USD 141 million) in Pierre Bastid\u2019s hotel business, Evok Collection, as a wager on expanding wellness-focused luxury hotels. The potential acquisition in the stake of the French family-owned hotel group sees the Courtin family holding company make a strategic play to diversify the company\u2019s portfolio which currently includes ownership over skincare brand Clarins.\nThe Courtin-Clarins family are the founders of the upscale cosmetics brand Groupe Clarins, who owns the private investment entity called Famille C Participations. Christian Courtin-Clarins and his brother Olivier Courtin-Clarins, sons of Clarins founder Jacques Courtin-Clarins, started the company in 2017. Famille C Participations provides financial resources and strategic expertise for minority investments in small-to-medium-sized European enterprises in the beauty, wellness, and sustainable development sectors. As it stands, Famille C also have investments in Ilia Beauty, Ceremonia, Pai Skincare, and Joone, as well as tech companies including Launchmetrics.\nFamille C Participations\u2019 \u00a314 Million (approximately USD 17.8) Reinvestment in Pai Skincare \nIn a press statement, Famille C reinforced its focus on investing in hotel companies that \u201ccreate unique experiences focused on well-being\u201d. Redefining luxury hotel standards by developing new lifestyles and travel experiences is exactly what the three co-founders of Evok had set out to do. Pierre Bastid, Romain Yzerman and general manager Emmanuel Sauvage created and built Evok in 2014, presenting a space of distinctive modern interpretation of European culture and a relaxed way of life amid an urban cosmopolitan city. The concept was to create a luxury service that would also provide unique experiences for the residents of the hotels and the communities around them.\nThe strategic investment further unites the world of beauty and well-being in an embodiment of Famille C\u2019s vision of the \u201cFrench art of living\u201d. \u201cThe desire to innovate and modernise the luxury hotel industry is one of the keys to Evok\u2019s success and one of the reasons for our partnership,\u201d explains Prisca Courtin, general manager of Famille C Participations.\nEvok\u2019s interior (Image courtesy of Evok Collection/ Paris Branch) \nTogether, Famille C and Evok Collection intend to expand their vision for luxury lodging, with a goal of 15 properties comprising of current hotels and upcoming outposts in the next five years. Evok Collection already has six such venues in Paris and Venice, and two more hotels in Madrid and Rome will soon open.\nIn a joint statement the two companies stated, \u201cWith this investment, Famille C Participations is implementing the strategy led by Prisca Courtin and her teams, naturally expanding its business into hotel experiences where well-being is central.\u201d Emmanuel Sauvage, managing director of Evok Collection explained, \u201cThis is a new stage for Evok Collection. United by a common vision, I\u2019m looking forward to continuing to write the Evok story together. I\u2019m convinced that this collaboration with the Famille C Participations team will lead us to new successes.\u201d\nThe spa at Evok Collection\u2019s Nolinksi Hotel in Paris. Image courtesy of Evok Collection (Businessoffashion) \nThe strategic investment comes at a time of growing trends in wellness and hospitality-related tourism. The convergence of the beauty and wellness industry goes hand in hand with delivering personalised brand experiences to customers. According to McKinsey & Co, the wellness market is worth USD 1.8 trillion in 2024. The health and beauty Industries are rapidly evolving with wellness retreats like Evok looking to serve their customers by ingratiating the best skincare products available like Clarins on the market. \nFor more on the latest in business and hospitality reads, click here."

    "text": "Utilising the \u201clipstick effect\u201d, can the power of perfumes and the blissful beauty industry overcome a slump in fashion sales? \nMarch 2024 sees the fashion industry enter a new precarious state. With a slew of longstanding creative directors stepping down, an impending economic downturn and sales slumps forcing brands to diversify, it appears as though the battle for profits comes down to the beauty industry. With consumers tightening their purse strings, brands are using their beauty and perfume lines vis-a-vis the \u201clipstick effect\u201d, which is an economic term whereby customers are more likely to spend money on small indulgences like a premium lipstick as opposed to large purchases. LUXUO looks at how the fashion industry plans to leverage on its beauty counterparts in the near future. \nCreative Director Conundrum \nDries Van Noten courtesy of Getty Images \nFirst, the creative director conundrum. Last week, Dries Van Noten released a statement confirming that he will be stepping down from his namesake brand at the end of June. \u201cI want to shift my focus to all the things I never had time for. I\u2019m sad, but at the same time, happy,\u201d said the Belgian fashion designer. Shortly after, Valentino\u2019s creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli announced that he would be leaving the Italian fashion house after 25 years to be a part of a new \u201ccreative organisation\u201d. However, if Ludovic de Saint Sernin\u2019s return to his eponymous brand upon leaving Ann Demeulemeester after a six-month stint in 2023 has taught us anything, it\u2019s that nothing is set in stone. These industry shifts could be a sign of new creative direction as seen with Alessandro Michele\u2019s Gucci and Jeremy Scott\u2019s Moschino or perhaps by the decisions made by anonymous stockholders. Perhaps now is the new era of the \u201call-encompassing creative director\u201d \u2014 the multi-hyphenate who understands fashion and fragrances. \nIf one recalls, it was Tom Ford that revolutionised the Gucci brand during his tenure from 1994 to 2004 with fragrances playing a key part of Gucci\u2019s expansion strategy. Gucci Envy, Gucci Rush and Gucci Pour Homme contributed to the brand\u2019s success in the perfume market but it was also his salacious campaigns that caused a controversy. At Gucci, he made the now-famous \u201cG\u201d logo \u201clanding strip\u201d for Gucci\u2019s Spring/Summer 2003 campaign but his rise in olfactory success arrived when he helmed his eponymous label Tom Ford with the Black Orchid and Neroli Portofino fragrance in the early 2000s. The fragrance line was marred with controversy for its hypersexualised (and now banned) \u201cvulva\u201d campaign visual which was a not-so-subliminal connotation that the fragrance was the smell of a woman\u2019s nether region. Alongside this, his salacious representation of Gucci\u2019s brand image saved the company from near bankruptcy.\nSales Slump Saved by Perfume Power\nLVMH fragrances, make-up, and luxury skincare \nNext came reports of luxury conglomerate Kering losing approximately USD 9 billion in market value after warning of a slump in China sales. As a result, luxury brands are turning to beauty. LUXUO previously discussed how luxury brands were leveraging on the growth of Southeast Asian countries. Now, LVMH-owned beauty brand Sephora aims to ride the \u201clipstick effect\u201d wave as it sees more growth amid the continuing economic downturn. \nAs of 2023, LVMH\u2019s Perfumes & Cosmetic sector is valued at USD 8,948 million with fragrance extensions of fashion houses including Stella by Stella McCartney, Parfums Christian Dior, Givenchy Parfums, Loewe Perfumes, Kenzo Parfums and most recently Celine Beaut\u00e9. Large conglomerates understand the value of the beauty and fragrance industry. There is a reason why Kering does not own Gucci\u2019s fragrance extension. In 2023, COTY CEO Sue Naby told journalists that \u201cthere will be no discussion on the renewal of any of our licences before at least 5 years,\u201d when asked about whether Kering would take back the licence for beauty products for its fashion label Gucci.\nBOSS Noble Wood Fragrance \nPerfumes are no longer sold as separate entities but are now marketed as the sensorial counterpart to a brand\u2019s sartorial selections and integrated into one\u2019s wardrobe. Take Hugo Boss\u2019 BOSS fragrance range for instance. Boss released a collection of 12 scents that mirror tailored pieces found in men\u2019s wardrobes. From the Courageous Rose that is aimed to mirror the touch of a silk tie on a suit to The invincible Bergamot that forms a powerful liaison with an urban leather coat. In opposition to generic fragrance marketing that evokes a mood or a sensual \u201cfantasy\u201d, each composition is tailored to be paired with a fabric \u2014 from suede to silk or outfit the final touch on an individual\u2019s look before heading out the door. \nBOSS Invincible Bergamot fragrance \nRead More: Luxury Powerhouses: Kering Buys 30 Percent of Valentino, LVMH Pays US $166 Million To Sponsor The Paris 2024 Summer Olympics\nThe Beauty Battle \nCeline Women\u2019s Winter \u201924 Triomphe range \nOnce again LVMH finds itself squaring up against Kering as Celine Beaut\u00e9 was announced earlier this month as the extension to the French luxury label under the helm of creative director Hedi Slimane. The creation of Celine beaut\u00e9 is an expansion from Celine\u2019s haute parfumerie collection launched in 2019 and is aimed at enriching the cultural roots, \u201cpromoting a French idea of femininity and allure, distilled over the last five years\u201d by Hedi Slimane in his new institutional codes for the Maison.\nSo why are fashion houses venturing into the beauty industry? First off, beauty allows for brand extension. By venturing into beauty and perfumes, fashion houses can extend their brand and offer a more comprehensive lifestyle experience to their customers. Beauty and fragrances allow fashion houses to reach a broader audience and engage with consumers who may not (in the current economic climate) purchase their clothing or accessories. This is how the aforementioned \u201clipstick effect\u201d strategy by LVMH comes into play. The division that houses Sephora was LVMH\u2019s fastest growing by sales in 2023, with the beauty retailer garnering a 20 percent increase in sales to approximately USD 19.3 billion and a 76 percent rise in profits to USD 1.51 billion. LVMH\u2019s new strategy is to hone in on the resilience of the beauty industry to carry them through any impending economic downturns in 2024. \nRead More: 9 Beauty Superstars in Focus\nNext, the diversification in launching beauty and perfume lines allows fashion houses to branch out into new revenue streams and reduce dependency on a single product category. This diversification can help mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in fashion trends and economic conditions. Next, the demand for luxury beauty and fragrance products is not as competitive as that of luxury fashion. Consumers seek quality and prestige over exclusivity. Fashion houses leverage their brands\u2019 prestige and craftsmanship to attract customers to their beauty and perfume offerings. \nFor more on the latest in fashion and beauty industry reads, click here."

After experiencing chronic injuries and food allergies while on the road, Jenelle sought out effective ways to heal herself through whole nutrition, creating convenient and nourishing snacks in her own kitchen (that her fellow ballerinas were obsessed with). And so Get Golden was born.\nBeyond her fervor for well-rounded pantry staples, Jenelle has become\u2014what we would call\u2014a Wellness Tastemaker with self-care rituals that are spa-worthy and can be done at home. We asked her how we can achieve peak wellness in our own homes, and we\u2019ll need her to guide us towards our best selves moving forward.\nFAVE WELLNESS TREND RIGHT NOW: Honest answers only! I\u2019m open to all \u201cwellness trends,\u201d but what I love most is when certain practices that were once deemed \u201cquackery\u201d become recognized and accepted ways to really help people. The best!\nMOST INSPIRING SPA EXPERIENCE: One of my favorite places in the world is Pantelleria, Italy, which has a super special hot water lake called Lago di Venere with the most incredible blue color. After you\u2019ve spent time swimming in it, you can lather yourself in this thermal volcanic mud nearby, then lay out to dry and bask in the sun. Your skin, muscles, and body feel absolutely incredible after. Mother Nature is my favorite spa!\nTHAT MOMENT YOU BECAME OBSESSED WITH WELLNESS: After years of struggling with chronic sports injuries and food allergies, I looked to alternative ways to heal my body and strengthen my system. I suppose you could say my obsession with wellness came from necessity.\nGO-TO SELF-CARE RITUAL: I love my morning skincare ritual, it\u2019s really a non-negotiable for me. I\u2019ll always wake up at least 30 minutes early no matter what time it is in order to have this sacred moment for myself. I love using my lymphatic facial brush and then my PureLift Pro for a quick wake up.

    "text": "Background \nI attended Glory Academy for my primary and secondary education. I went on to bag a degree in Adult Education/Political Science from the University of Ibadan. \nTo be honest, the course I studied was not by choice. The plan was to transfer to another department in my second year but after starting the course, I started enjoying it and decided to stay. \nActing\nI like to say I found myself in acting. It was not my intention, but it is a career that found me and as of this moment, I\u2019m thankful for it. I was allowed to do a short skit by someone and from there, came the next opportunity. And, I just decided to follow that path. \nModelling \nWhen I was in my second year in the university, a photographer approached me and asked me to model for him, with the promise to pay me. I made sure it was legitimate and safe, and I went for it. After that, I got other requests. From then, I decided to take it seriously, and put myself out there more. The more I did that, the more calls I got.\nCareer \nThe COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 made it tougher to get modelling gigs because of the social distancing measures in place. To pass the time, I started making short TikTok videos, lip-syncing to other people\u2019s sounds. I made a bunch of those, then an older friend asked me to do a one-minute video and monologue. I was nervous but I did it anyway. I had fun shooting it, and he asked if I wanted to pursue acting actively. I told him I was not sure but that I intended to pursue every opportunity I got, and try my hands on anything I could, as long as it was legal. After that, his friend reached out to me and asked if I could play the lead character in a feature film. I was in a lot of doubt and considered turning it down, but I did it anyway. That is one opportunity I am thankful for, because it snowballed into more. I thank God and the people who gave me those opportunities. \nWura \nWorking on the set of the TV series, Wura, was indeed a wonderful experience. Not only did I get to share the screen with big names in the industry, I also made friends beyond the screen. Meeting those people gave me butterflies in my tummy, but my first day on the set was warm and welcoming. Nobody minded my age or size; they treated me with kindness, and we had moments behind the cameras filled with laughter. It was great. \nMy character in the series was a typical Gen Z, which I found very interesting and refreshing. Playing that role gave me the ability to explore a range of emotions outside my comfort zone, and allowed me to get better at my craft. \nBiracial \nBeing biracial and trying to climb up the ladder in the industry, there is a common misconception that physical features are all there is to my person. Due to this, there was the inherent need to constantly prove myself and try to go the extra mile to show that I was not just about being a pretty face.\nHowever, an older friend helped me realise that a pretty face could get me into a room, and that it\u2019s not a bad thing. But, what I can offer would then keep me in that room. Culturally, I am probably more Yoruba than some full-blooded Yoruba women, so that has never been an issue. On the contrary, it is a bonus. \nBalance \nBalancing both acting and modelling has not been the easiest thing to do due to having to be at different locations filming. However, I try as much as possible to plan shoots and other work engagements around the free time I get. That way, none gets in the way of the other. \nMemories \nIn 2023, I attended the Africa Magic Viewers\u2019 Choice Awards, and it was very memorable for me. It is the biggest award event in the industry and getting to experience that with the Wura family was truly remarkable. \nChallenges \nI have faced the heartbreak that comes with not getting callbacks from auditions, as well as the occasional imposter syndrome that makes me think I don\u2019t belong where I am (especially because I did not study anything film-related). I have to constantly do something to prove myself, which I use as motivation to search for more and keep improving constantly. However, the biggest challenge so far has to be the realisation that there are people who have a mental image they have created of me that they expect me to be. With the name comes people who are watching and scrutinising one\u2019s every move. One has to be careful with what one says so it is not misinterpreted. One always has be friendly and be all smiles, which basically means one is not allowed to have a bad day.\nIt seems like some people forget that celebrities are human beings too. They have bad days, and are not always put together and proper, just like everybody else. They sometimes just want peace, and they don\u2019t feel safe talking to strangers on the Internet and sharing personal information. I love my fans, but I really would love more space for people to be themselves without pressure. But again, it is part of what we signed up for and we cannot complain. \nRejection \nEvery rejection is a motivation to get better and aim higher. It will not always be a bed of roses, and it\u2019s all part of the journey. In dealing with people and the attention I get, I try to always be myself, which means being authentic while still showing love and respect for the people who show me love and support me. \nSupport \nI can categorically say I have the best people in my corner, in terms of family and support systems. They gave me the courage I needed to pursue this career path. They are the ones that support my work by sharing and promoting me in every way they can. The prayers and encouragement are never-ending, helping me prepare for auditions and giving constructive criticisms where necessary. The advice and words of affirmations just make everything better. The list is endless, and indeed, they have been a blessing. \nFocus \nI would say God and Godly relationships have helped me stay sane. I usually say that it is hard for me to go bad, because I have too many people in my corner who will not allow it. I stay true and accountable to people, who will not hesitate to check me if I start to misbehave; and that has been helpful.\nAdvice \nTo people looking to get into any of these career paths, I would say don\u2019t give up, keep trying because all you need is one big break and you won\u2019t get it if you stop. Also, it is better to try and fail, than not to try at all, so make good use of the opportunities you have and start where you are. \nRoles \nI cannot give specifics but I can say I look forward to taking on more challenging roles that would push me to explore different personality types away from my person. \nChanges \nFashion and beauty standards will continue to evolve and that is a fact. However, I believe it is relative, which means one might not be standard to one person, but there is always something out there that works for one at times. So, with each wave of change, find what works for you in that season, and don\u2019t try to change just to fit into a particular box. If not, you will find yourself having to change over and over, and possibly lose yourself in the process. I stay true to myself and I try not to change just to suit trends. \nGoals\nI plan on trying my hands at directing and producing soon. I also plan on doing something in the creative space majorly for young aspiring creatives, who need a community to aid their growth. \nSocial media \nSocial media has played an active role in my career. I believe it should reflect who one is. This means if someone goes through my page, they should have an idea of what kind of person I am and also, it is the first point of call for most people who want to work with one to check who one is. I try to engage people on my page. However, I try to be careful with interactions to avoid any miscommunication while still maintaining some forms of engagement. \nInfluence \nMy academic background is a far cry away from the industry I am in, which means there isn\u2019t much to be influenced by. However, I can say it helped me build people skills, which is handy in my line of work. \nWork-life \nWith this, I am still learning, because I enjoy working a lot and I am not the most social person. However, I am a work in progress. I am learning to take compulsory breaks and rests.\nBeauty \nI do not have a beauty regime. I am not a typical skincare person. I recently just started applying vitamin C serum, moisturiser, and sunscreen, so that I can be like the \u2018girlies\u2019. I owe this beauty to God and good genes. I claim no credit for it. \nFashion \nA nice top, with loose pants and crocs (footwear) is my go-to. I love to be comfortable in whatever I wear. However, these days I am making more efforts to look more girly and explore the clean girl look with neutral tones. Pinterest (a picture sharing platform) has been my best friend so far. \nRelaxation \nI sleep. I feel like when I\u2019m working, I never get enough sleep; so whenever I get breaks and breathing space, I like to catch up on lost sleep and fill up in advance for the next day. Aside from that, I enjoy occasional outings with friends, food dates, and basic hangouts. I am not very outdoorsy but with the right motivation, you can catch me outside."

    "text": "Updated - April 01, 2024 at 10:13 AM. \nBollywood\u2019s entrepreneurial leap is seeing stars use their fame and influence to co-create winning brands \nRedefining glamour: (Clockwise from left) Kids wear from Zip Zap Zoop, MyGlamm\u2019s POUT, Kareena Kapoor with SUGAR cosmetics founders, Florence by Mills and lipsticks from Manish Malhotra Beauty | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement \nGuess who is hitting the jackpot on India\u2019s start-up street? Their films might be hit or miss, but Bollywood celebrities are finding huge success with the brands they are co-creating. \nTake Katrina Kaif, who teamed up with beauty and lifestyle retailer, Nykaa, to launch Kay Beauty in 2019. Nearly 1.5 million consumers have bought the products of this brand so far. Earlier this month, Falguni Nayar, Executive Chairperson, Founder and CEO of Nykaa, pointed out that Kay Beauty was the \u201cthird-most searched\u201d direct-to-consumer brand on the platform and also among \u201cthe top three brands at Nykaa\u2019s stores\u201d. She said, \u201cKay Beauty is expected to grow at the rate of 62 per cent after a robust year of expansion into new doors (retail stores).\u201d \nNayar said that the brand was created by Katrina Kaif and Nykaa, to \u201cbridge the gap between high glamour and care.\u201d With a 1.4 million-strong Instagram community, the brand\u2019s lip oils were sold out in one day demonstrating its prowess in bringing international trends to the forefront, she added. \nWinning partnerships \nEqually sweet has been the brand outing of Kareena Kapoor Khan. Last year, she formed a strategic partnership with SUGAR Cosmetics founders Vineeta Singh & Kaushik Mukherjee to launch a premium Korean skincare brand, Quench Botanics. \nKaushik Mukherjee, Director, Quench Botanics told brandline, \u201cWhen the superstar and beauty icon Kareena Kapoor Khan loved the Quench products, she came on board as a co-owner and investor, affirming faith in the brand. Sales have more than doubled for quarter-on-quarter. A substantial increase in the follower base was also observed on our Instagram platform. Associating with her has helped step up the brand\u2019s awareness and reach significantly amongst consumers.\u201d\nAlso read\nMukherjee pointed out that Quench Botanics\u2019 proposition of accessible Korean skincare tailored for Indian skin and weather conditions resonated well with consumers. \nAccording to Sukhleen Aneja, CEO, Good Brands Co, Good Glamm Group, celeb-led brands are thriving in today\u2019s beauty market as they gain instant recognition and recall. \u201cWe partnered with Manish Malhotra in 2018 to create and launch Manish Malhotra Beauty by MyGlamm, which has become one of the largest luxury makeup brands of India. These kinds of partnerships enable us to tap into diverse consumer segments and engage with them in innovative ways gaining access to their loyal fan bases,\u201d she says. \nBesides co-creating a brand, the beauty major has also come up with celeb-anchored limited-edition collections and exclusive launches. \u201cOur most recent launch of the MyGlamm POUT collection in partnership with Karan Johar in December 2023 was a huge success and has gone on to be the No 1 best-selling lipstick for MyGlamm on platforms like Amazon,\u201d she added. \nFor film stars, feted for their looks, it\u2019s natural to segue into the booming beauty industry and the associations with new age start-ups is paying off. \nNayar said as India\u2019s per capita income rises from $2,500 today to $5,500 by 2030, it is projected that the BPC (beauty and personal care ) per capita spend will go from $15 today to $50 by 2030 in India. \nBusiness acumen \nNone of these are vanity projects; they are raking in the moolah, backed by large communities of loyal fans. In fact some of these ventures are backed by VCs and angel investors. Take for instance, Deepika Padukone\u2019s \u201cself-care\u201d brand 82\u00b0E, which raised $7.5 million in seed funding in early 2022. DSG Consumer Partners and IDEO Ventures along with other angel investors participated in the round. And just last month, the brand \u2014 which has a presence in the body care and women skincare segment \u2014 expanded into the men\u2019s skincare category. \nBut celebs aren\u2019t restricting themselves to the beauty segment alone. They are monetising their popularity with business ventures in a wide array of segments. Shipa Shetty Kundra, who has several business interests, has invested in many ventures. Her early bet as an investor on Mamaearth-owner Honasa Consumer yielded her massive returns when it got listed at the bourses. \nHer latest foray is in the kids-wear space with a brand called Zip Zap Zoop, launched in partnership with Ashmika Sadh. \u201cShilpa Shetty is a household name. Her expertise as a mother and a fashion icon combined with my manufacturing background led to this collaboration,\u201d said Sadh. She added that the online brand now wants to focus on offline expansion besides setting up stores in tier-2 and tier-3 cities.\nLast year, actor Sanjay Dutt forayed into the alcohol business with the launch of his scotch whiskey brand, The Glenwalk. This was launched on the back of his investment in Mumbai-based alcobev start-up Cartel & Bros. Jittin S Merani, Co-Founder, Cartel Bros, said, \u201cIn the competitive landscape of the Indian alcohol beverage industry, The Glenwalk has swiftly risen to prominence, thanks to a strategic partnership with Bollywood superstar Sanjay Dutt.\u201d \nGlobally celebs have had a great track record of creating winning brands thanks to their OG influencer status. Notable examples are Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty, Kylie Jenner\u2019s Kylie Cosmetics and Ariana Grande\u2019s REM Beauty. In fact, some of the celeb-owned or co-owned brands have been sold at hefty valuations. Actor Ryan Reynolds successfully sold a stake in Aviation American Gin and few other brands to Diageo at over $600 million valuation. It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if we see a celeb-owned brand emerging as a unicorn soon in India."

    "text": "Gen Z youths are bringing back tanning, much to the chagrin of older generations who learned too late of the damages inflicted by sunbeds, UV rays and tanning oils.\nDespite the wealth of information available about the health risks of tanning, like premature aging and skin cancer, the skincare-obsessed generation is, ironically, flocking to tanning beds. This comes amid a revival of Y2K trends \u2014 just look at cigarettes \u2014 reminiscent of the early aughts era of \u201cGym, Tan, Laundry\u201d and heart-shaped \u201ctan tattoos.\u201d\nDespite the wealth of health advisories, Gen Z is frequenting tanning beds. Getty Images/iStockphoto \nTikToker Hollie Evelyn once said she would \u201crather die hot than live ugly.\u201d TikTok/@hollieevelynxo \nAccording to recent data from the American Academy of Dermatology, 20% of Gen Zers believe that being tan is more important to them than protecting themselves from skin cancer, and 30% admitted that they would rather look \u201cgreat\u201d today with a tan \u201ceven if it means looking worse later in life.\u201d\nTikToker Hollie Evelyn once said she would \u201crather die hot than live ugly,\u201d a sentiment that is echoed by thousands on the platform who hawk tanning tips and tricks under the tag #sunbed, while the tag #tanning has amassed over 4 billion views.\n26-year-old Holly Reardon, whose tan makes her feel thinner and prettier, has been inundated with tanning content on her social media feeds, telling the Washington Post that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t care\u201d so much about looking sun-kissed if she \u201cdidn\u2019t have social media.\u201d\nA recent survey found that 20% of Gen Zers believe being tan is more important than protecting themselves from skin cancer. Getty Images \nSabrina, a 24-year-old New Yorker whose name was changed for anonymity, went in a tanning bed for the first time when she was just 16. She told Nylon that her mom insisted she needed a \u201cbase\u201d tan to avoid a sunburn on their tropical vacation \u2014 a theory that has been debunked by experts. However, her habit continued in college where the gym offered free tanning beds with a membership.\nFor her, being bronzed \u2014 which has long been regarded as a status symbol, linked to the privilege of poolside lounging, tropical vacations and abundant wealth \u2014 is tied to beauty.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m feeling ugly, I will focus more on tanning because I just get more compliments when I\u2019m tan,\u201d she told Nylon. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m worried about the health risks, but I smoke cigarettes and I never wear sunscreen.\u201d\nTanning \u2014 by either bed or beach \u2014 accelerates signs of aging like wrinkles, spots and lack of elasticity and also increases the risk of skin cancer. Indoor tanning increases the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma by 58% and basal cell carcinoma by 24%, and can cause melanoma, a rarer but deadlier type of skin cancer.\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a healthy tan if your tan is from a tanning bed or exposure to the sun,\u201d Dr. Jennifer Holman, a dermatologist located in Texas, told Yahoo News.\nBeing tan has been tied to beauty, health and thinness, despite the risks it poses. Getty Images \nUnlike the heyday of bronzed complexions 20 years ago, there are more products than ever that provide the same sun-kissed glow without skin damage \u2014 no UV rays, no problem.\n\u201cYear after year, we continue to see so much innovation in self-tanning and bronzing products,\u201d Penny Coy, an Ulta Beauty executive who works in merchandizing, told the Washington Post. \nWhile spray tans are one complexion-conscious option, mists, drops, powders, creams, mousses, oils and sprays \u2014 not to mention the mitts, brushes and applicators required to achieve a seamless, streakless glow \u2014 line the shelves at Sephora, Ulta and Target for tan addicts to get their fix.\nAnd yet, even with the cutting-edge products on the market, Gen Z still touts sunbeds despite their dangers, and even associates tanning with the aesthetic of health.\n\u201cI feel like I look healthier, so that makes me happier,\u201d Sara Shammout, a 23-year-old student and founder of the tan accelerating cream brand Bronzed by Carrot, told the Washington Post. \n\u201cProjecting the right image is more important to people than living the type of the life that that image suggests,\u201d DeFino said. Getty Images \nSome people also believe that tanning booths offer more benefits than a bronze glow. When Kim Kardashian, for one, boasted about her in-office sunbed in a widely criticized video posted to social media, her fans speculated that it may be used to treat her psoriasis.\nExperts, however, have debunked the belief that tanning beds can quell the symptoms of skin conditions, as it is not the same as medicinal light therapy used by clinicians due to the notable lack of UVB rays emissions, which are necessary for the body to make vitamin D and are more effective at treating certain conditions than the UVA rays in sunbeds.\nBeauty writer Jessica DeFino argues that social standards are forcing people to contort themselves for the sake of beauty and place aesthetics over wellbeing by any means necessary \u2014 just look at the abuse of weight loss jabs. If they truly cared about leading a healthy lifestyle like their appearance would suggest, they wouldn\u2019t dare enter a tanning booth.\n\u201cProjecting the right image is more important to people than living the type of the life that that image suggests,\u201d DeFino said."

    "text": "Business News/ Industry / Premiumization, omnichannel trends, diversity to shape marketing in India: Kantar report \n2 min read 12 Mar 2024, 08:40 PM IST Join us \nThis shift, alongside an increase in digital marketing and e-commerce, reflects the diverse preferences of a youthful demographic and an affluent, value-conscious consumer base\nPremium Moving beyond traditional advertising, there's an accelerating shift towards e-commerce and digital marketing among large companies. (Image: Pixabay) \nNEW DELHI : Indian brands, both small and large, are looking to overhaul marketing strategies to match the evolving behaviour of consumers. A report by researcher Kantar indicated a shift towards localized marketing practices, targeting specific age groups such as Gen Z, Gen Alpha and millennials.\nThe transition seeks to address emerging trends, including a growing preference for premium products and online shopping, as well as a shift towards gender-inclusive advertising. The diverse consumer demographics are also driving brands to fine-tune their marketing strategies, specifically to resonate with the younger generation, who are redefining social media engagement and are boldly expressing their values on family and identity, given that India boasts around 116 million shoppers, with Gen Z accounting for 40% of urban consumers aged 15-55 years.\nYet, the diversity within the consumer groups calls for nuanced marketing strategies, Kantar said. \u201cGenZ and Millennials are estimated to comprise nearly half of India\u2019s population by 2030. Are such large cohorts really that homogenous? However, the obsession with younger cohorts means that brands are potentially ignoring an increasingly affluent and willing to spend older target group,\" it added.\nThe aspirations and desires of the youth from small towns and metropolitan areas vary significantly, and, thus, \u201ctargeting them with similar offers and in the same way is unlikely to win them over,\" Kantar said.\nThe report mirrors the evolving landscape, with brands and marketers exploring innovative methods to connect with consumers, marking a departure from traditional advertising, following a growing emphasis on e-commerce and digital marketing among major players such as Nestle India Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, underscoring the focus on product innovation.\nAccording to Kantar, rising affluence is fuelling higher consumer spending, especially on luxury items, leading to growing demand in emerging categories such as trending cosmetics and skincare products.\nConsumer demand for big-ticket items is at an all-time high, it added. \u201cIndians have more money than ever and desire to spend it, but value consciousness remains, and value is more than price. Contrary to the popular perception, \u2018value for money\u2019 is not equal to inexpensive or cheap, but about the price worthiness of what the consumer buys,\" said Soumya Mohanty, managing director and chief client officer, Kantar.\nIn this dynamic market, brands are adjusting their consumer engagement strategies to align with evolving patterns of consumer engagement.\nIn an interview, Harman Dhillon, executive director designate, beauty and wellbeing, HUL, said a different marketing model is emerging as Indians become more affluent and consumer needs diversify. This is especially true for categories such as beauty and personal care where social media is driving great influence on shopper behaviour.\nAs a result, companies are spending more on digital media activations, at least for such categories. Mohanty said advertising narratives are also shifting towards more balanced gender representations, and moving away from traditional stereotypes for men and women.\nMeanwhile, as per Kantar Worldpanel, omnichannel shopping has seen a significant increase in urban India, indicating a future where connected commerce along with a hybrid shopping experience will become the norm, allowing consumers to explore, compare and purchase products across multiple platforms.\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

ET reported on secondary stake sales on March 21.\nET reported on April 4 that strong, fast-growing and profit-focused businesses such as Lenskart, Purplle, Healthkart, Rapido and Zepto are snagging over $100-million deals.\nFrom the other side\n\nFounders are also increasingly turning to investment banks, as against during the funding boom, when entrepreneurs would close deals independently.\n\u201cCompanies that haven\u2019t seen a round in the past few years are seeing $20-30 million primary rounds, and those closer to an IPO (public listing) or an M&A, are seeing secondary interest,\u201d said The Rainmaker Group\u2019s Chanchani. Banker-led deals have increased substantially also because assistance is needed for secondary processes and the pools of capital are seeing rapid churn, he said.\nChanchani said January-March was Rainmaker\u2019s best quarter, when it closed seven deals, following a standstill in the previous four to five months.\nShivakumar Ramaswami, founder and director of IndigoEdge, said the investment banking firm facilitated four deals in the previous quarter and three in the December quarter. \u201cWhat has changed is on the growth side,\u201d he said. \u201cPrivate equity or sovereign funds that are much more measured are taking their time for diligence and are pricing rounds the way they want to. Having said that, easy money that was flowing earlier from hedge funds and crossover funds is not there.\u201d\nA Mumbai-based banker said that in addition to domestic investors and family offices, private equity and sovereign funds are also getting into tech investing in a big way. But their timelines for closing deals are longer, at nine to 12 months, he said.\nFounders, especially in the early stage, are turning to investment banks to raise capital, unlike fundraises till 2022. At the time, \u201csentiment was still in favour of founders\u2026 Being an operationally healthy company, we could command terms,\u201d said a Gurgaon-based founder of a mobility startup, currently in the market to raise $40-45 million.\nAccording to Tracxn data, funding in Indian startups marked a positive trend over the last three months. Deals worth $449 million were struck in January, followed by $799 million in February and $747 million in March. However, year-on-year, the total $2 billion raised in the quarter is still around 38% lower than the $3.3-billion deals announced during January-March 2023.\nWhat next?\n\nThough the overall funding scenario remains subdued, industry executives are of the view that the pipeline could swell as startups grow into valuations ascribed to them during the boom of 2021 and 2022.\n\u201cFounders have realised\u2026 \u2018We are not being rewarded for growth only. So, we\u2019ll grow a little slowly but let\u2019s make unit economics efficient\u2019,\u201d said Vinod Murali, managing partner at venture debt fund Alteria Capital. \u201cWe have a lot of companies at breakeven; some have even turned profitable\u2026 they have grown 30-40%, maybe not 200%, therefore growing into their valuations.\u201d\nThe overall investment landscape is a gentler slope from the 2021 highs as founder expectations on valuations moderate and investors look to write smaller cheques.\n\u201cOn an average, valuations have tempered by 20-25% (from 2021), especially at early stages with pricing becoming more sensible,\u201d said Harshjit Sethi, managing director at Peak XV Partners. \u201cWhile funding has not increased dramatically, we see a lot of companies that had raised their seed rounds in 2021 and 2022 coming back to the market (this year) after achieving product-market fit.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, we expect more investment activity this year, as a result of companies improving their fundamentals (or economic profile) and newer company formations taking place in sectors such as AI (artificial intelligence) and deeptech,\u201d said Sethi.\n(With inputs from Tarush Bhalla in Bengaluru)"

    "text": "Dublin, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Global Vitamin A Market: Analysis By Type, By Product, By Application, By Region Size,Trends and Forecast to 2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\nThe global vitamin A market value stood at US$548.36 million in 2023 and is expected to reach US$745.84 million by 2029.\nThe continuous growth of the global vitamin A market can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the rise in the geriatric population worldwide has contributed significantly to the increased demand for vitamin A, as older individuals often require additional nutritional support. Secondly, the growth in feed fortification practices in the agriculture industry has led to higher consumption of vitamin A among livestock, indirectly boosting human intake through animal products. Additionally, the increasing consumer spending on skincare products, driven by a growing awareness of skin health, has fueled the demand for vitamin A in topical formulations. Moreover, the expansion of the dietary supplement industry has provided consumers with easier access to vitamin A supplements. The rising demand for functional foods, fortified with essential nutrients including vitamin A, has also contributed to market growth. Furthermore, the surge in eye and skin disorders and the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency have emphasized the importance of adequate vitamin A intake, further propelling market expansion. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.26% over the projected period of 2024-2029.\nMarket Segmentation Analysis:\nBy Product: Synthetic segment held the highest share in the market and Natural segment is expected to be the fastest growing segment in the forecasted period. The preference for synthetic Vitamin A is primarily due to its cost-effectiveness and widespread availability, making it a popular choice among manufacturers and consumers alike. On the other hand, the increasing consumer preference for natural and organic products, driven by health and sustainability concerns, is expected to drive the growth of Natural Vitamin A. Consumers are increasingly seeking products derived from natural sources, leading to a surge in demand for natural alternatives, thus fueling the projected growth of this segment in the market.\nBy Product: The Feed Grade Vitamin A held the highest share in the market and the Pharmaceutical Grade is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the forecasted period. Feed Grade dominates due to its extensive use in animal feed to support optimal health and growth in livestock, poultry, and aquaculture. On the other hand, the projected growth of Pharmaceutical Grade is driven by increasing demand in the pharmaceutical industry for manufacturing medications, supplements, and formulations aimed at improving human health and well-being. The pharmaceutical sector's emphasis on quality, purity, and stringent regulatory standards further contributes to the expected growth of this segment, as consumers prioritize efficacy and safety in pharmaceutical products.\nBy Material: Animal Feed held the highest share in the market and Cosmetics is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the forecasted period. With the global demand for meat, dairy, and eggs on the rise, fortified animal feed is increasingly vital to ensure optimal animal health and productivity. This growth is propelled by heightened awareness of the importance of vitamin A in animal nutrition and the focus on improving feed efficiency and animal performance. Likewise, the Cosmetics segment is driven by increasing consumer awareness of skincare and beauty products containing Vitamin A, which is known for its benefits in improving skin texture, reducing signs of aging, and promoting overall skin health. As consumers prioritize natural and effective ingredients in cosmetics, the demand for Vitamin A-infused skincare products is expected to surge, contributing to the rapid growth of this segment.\nBy Region: North America is the largest region of the vitamin A market and presents a promising landscape. Notably, countries like the US, Canada, and Mexico contribute significantly to this market, each shaped by unique elements shaping their vitamin A realm. In North America, advanced healthcare infrastructure, increasing consumer awareness about preventive healthcare, and a growing demand for functional foods and supplements drive the robust market growth. Specifically, the US leads with its well-established pharmaceutical and dietary supplement industries, while Canada boasts a thriving healthcare sector and growing interest in natural health products.\nAsia Pacific stands out as the fastest-growing region in the vitamin A sector due to rapid industrialization, urbanization, and increasing disposable income. In Asia Pacific, demand for dietary supplements and fortified foods is escalating owing to rising health consciousness and lifestyle changes. Specifically, China, the region's largest market, experiences robust growth driven by its large population, expanding middle class, and growing focus on preventive healthcare. India, with its burgeoning pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries, showcases significant potential for vitamin A market expansion. Overall, Asia Pacific's dynamic market landscape positions it as a key player in the global vitamin A sector.\nGlobal Vitamin A Market Dynamics:\nGrowth Drivers: The global vitamin A market growth is predicted to be supported by numerous growth drivers such rise in the geriatric population, growth in feed fortification, rising consumer spending on skincare products, expansion in the dietary supplement industry, rising demand for functional foods, surge in eye and skin disorders, rising prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, etc. As individuals age, their nutritional needs often increase, including the need for vitamin A to support eye health, immune function, and overall well-being. Moreover, the growth in feed fortification practices in the agriculture industry contributes to increased consumption of vitamin A through animal products, subsequently boosting human intake. Fortifying animal feed with vitamin A ensures that livestock, poultry, and aquaculture receive adequate nutrition, ultimately enhancing the quality of animal-derived products consumed by humans. These drivers collectively contribute to the overall growth of the vitamin A market.\nChallenges: However, the market growth would be negatively impacted by various challenges such as strict regulatory compliance, high cost, etc. Strict regulatory compliance poses a significant challenge to the growth of the global vitamin A market. Regulatory bodies impose stringent standards and guidelines regarding the production, labeling, and marketing of vitamin A products to ensure consumer safety and product efficacy. Meeting these compliance requirements often entails extensive testing, documentation, and adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, which can increase production costs and time-to-market. Failure to comply with regulatory mandates can result in penalties, product recalls, and damage to brand reputation, hindering market growth.\nTrends: The market is projected to grow at a fast pace during the forecasted period, due to market trends like rise of e-commerce, influence of social media, growing demand for natural and organic vitamin A, personalized subscription boxes, focus on nutritional fortification of infant formula and baby food, etc. With the increasing popularity of online shopping platforms, consumers have greater accessibility to a wide range of vitamin A products from various brands and suppliers.\nThis convenience factor, coupled with the ability to compare prices and read product reviews online, has contributed to the surge in online purchases of vitamin A supplements, skincare products, and fortified foods. Additionally, the growing preference for natural and organic products, fueled by health and sustainability concerns, leads to increased demand for vitamin A sourced from natural sources, such as fruits and vegetables.

    "text": "(Image credit: Stocksy/Collage by Makena Frederick)\nAs beauty editors, we're constantly tracking, testing, and talking about new beauty trends. That goes for skincare, makeup, haircare, and fragrance. Conversations regarding the latter get especially intense. You see, the Who What Wear beauty team is pretty much scent-obsessed. Each editor has strong opinions on which perfumes are worth their price tags, although we agree on a few favorites.\nWe've had one particular trend on our radar for a minute, and seeing as it seemed to have reached a zenith, we decided to delve into it. We're talking about deep, dark, and sultry vanilla scents. That's right\u2014these aren't your mother's vanilla perfumes. We're talking darker, richer, deeper, and more mysterious ones. In other words, they're a cool 2024 take on a classic.\nWe realize that might sound like an oxymoron. After all, vanilla is known for being sweet, warm, and comforting. It's the scent of fresh-baked cookies and sugary-smelling candles. How dark and mysterious can it really be? As it turns out, the answer is very. And a wide variety of brands are proving it\u2014from affordable to indie to prestige brands. Think Tom Ford, Byredo, Ellis Brooklyn, Henry Rose, and Snif among others. So without further ado, keep scrolling to see one beauty editor sound off on eight of the sultriest vanilla scents out there.\nD.S. & Durga\nDeep Dark Vanilla Eau De Parfum\nFragrance notes: Cabreuva, orchid, pink pepper, vines, green vanilla leaves, cypress root, vanilla absolute, dark patchouli, hay\nThe hot take: If I had to describe this fragrance in two words, they would be enticing and interesting. It's made with real vanilla (not synthetic), so it has a rich creaminess that vanilla-wearers will love, but I sensed the sharper, earthier notes of vines, cypress root, and dark patchouli first. That's why, even though this fragrance is genderless, it has a masculine edge. It reminds me of walking through an old bookstore where the shelves are arranged in a labyrinth and the smell of old wood and paper linger in the air. That's specific, I know, but it's where the scent took me. \nTOM FORD\nVanilla Sex Eau De Parfum\nFragrance notes: Vanilla tincture, vanilla absolute, sandalwood, bitter almond essence, tonka absolute\nThe hot take: This one is interesting, because it has all the creaminess, warmth, and comfort of a traditional sweet vanilla fragrance, yet there's a sultry, sexy, and luxurious edge to it. It's like they took a standard vanilla fragrance and made it richer and rounder. There aren't any sharp edges or piercing notes\u2014just a truly lavish-smelling vanilla. I want to wear it while draped on a chaise lounge if that gives you any sense of what it smells like. \nTOM FORD\nVanille Fatale Eau De Parfum\nFragrance notes: Vanilla, mahogany wood, coffee absolute, roasted barley\nThe hot take: If Tom Ford's Vanilla Sex is soft and sultry, this scent is dark, rich, and robust\u2014like a vanilla macchiato. It's the dark woods, coffee absolute, and roasted barley notes that pull the sweet vanilla scent down, making it smell deeper and more, well, expensive than it would otherwise. If you're searching for a true, sultry fragrance, this one is it. \nKayali\nKayali Vanilla | 28\nFragrance notes: Vanilla orchids, jasmine, tonka absolute, amber wood, musk, patchouli, brown sugar\nThe hot take: I'd classify this scent as gourmand (meaning a sweet scent. which unsurprisingly, most vanilla fragrances are). The soft floral notes of orchid and jasmine mingle with warm, grounding notes of tonka, amber, and musk. It really is lovely, and it seems like a fragrance that would be pretty much universally loved. That's why I think this is the perfect starter perfume, per se, for anyone who wants to dip their toes into the deep end without taking a leap. \nEllis Brooklyn\nVanilla Milk Eau De Parfum\nFragrance notes: bourbon vanilla bean extract, upcycled cocoa shell, frangipani, milk accord\nThe hot take: Like Kayali Vanilla 28, this scent is a true gourmand, with candied notes of cocoa and frangipani (a flowering tropical plant). Thanks to the bourbon vanilla and milk accord, it smells incredibly creamy\u2014think Starbucks' vanilla cream cold brew. Again, this strikes me as a scent that would be pretty much universally loved; there are no sharp, unexpected, or controversial notes. To me, it's another sultry starter perfume. But, who knows, you might love it enough to make it your signature like so many people already have. \nFragrance notes: Freesia, plum, amber, cashmere woods, Madagascar vanilla beans, cistus oil\nThe hot take: This scent is so alluring and addictive that it's hard to put it down once you pick it up. To me, it's the closest any fragrance has ever come to smelling like pure vanilla extract\u2014the warm, rich kind you bake with. That said, it's not basic or boring. In fact, it's quite the opposite. It's rich and sophisticated. It's so, so good. That's all I can say. New date night perfume, unlocked. \nSnif\nVanilla Vice Eau de Toilette\nFragrance notes: Ice cream, Madagascar vanilla, jasmine, amber wood, musk, orcanox\nThe hot take: This scent starts strong with a note of ice cream. Yep, you read that right\u2014ice cream. But don't automatically assume that it's soft and simple. The rich Madagascar vanilla and musky ambergris notes give it an edge. The result is a scent that's still vanilla-y, yet way woodier and earthier than I would have expected. It was a surprise, but surprises can be good. \nHenry Rose\nTorn Eau De Parfum\nFragrance notes: Vanilla bean, praline, freesia, rose, violet, jasmine, musk, sandalwood, vetiver roots\nThe hot take: At first, I couldn't decide if this smelled more floral, earthy, or creamy. I was so undecided that I settled on all three. Once it dried down, though, it turned into something warmer and spicier, probably thanks to the notes of praline and vetiver roots. It's definitely what I'd consider a complex take on a traditional vanilla scent, and it's yet another that I can't stop sniffing. That goes for other people, too. Since wearing it, I've had three people stop me and exclaim, \"You smell so good!\"\nShop 6 More Sultry Scents We Love\n5 SENS\nBurn for You Eau De Parfum\nCreamy Madagascar vanilla mingles with cashmere musk and amber.\nTOM FORD\nFucking Fabulous Eau De Parfum Fragrance\nA woody, spicy scent, this one's made up of leather, tonka bean, and sage notes.\nValentino\nDonna Born in Roma Eau De Parfum\nWe could wear this warm floral fragrance every day and never get sick of it.\nYves Saint Laurent\nLibre Eau De Parfum\nAnother warm floral, this combines notes of lavender, orange blossom, and musk.\nVersace\nBright Crystal Eau de Toilette\nIf you're looking for something a tad lighter, you can't miss with this cult-classic perfume from Versace which somehow manages to be fruity, floral, and musky. It's juicy and addictive.\nKaitlyn McLintock is an Associate Beauty Editor at Who What Wear.

    "text": "Dublin, April 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Korea Cosmetics (K-Beauty) Market: Analysis By Type, By Category, By Distribution Channel, By Exports, By Production, Size and Trends with Impact of COVID-19 and Forecast up to 2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\nKorea cosmetics market value stood at US$6.57 billion in 2023, and is expected to reach US$9.05 billion by 2029. Export value of Korea cosmetics market was US$7.65 billion in 2023.\nintroduction of 'same-day' and 'early morning' delivery services by domestic online channels, growing popularity of K-dramas, increasing consumer emphasis on the use of high-quality ingredients, and rising awareness and acceptance of makeup among men is expected to continue to boost the growth of Korea cosmetics market at a CAGR of 5.48% in the forecasted period of 2024-2029.\nThe Korea cosmetics market, also known as K-beauty, refers to the industry engaged in the production, distribution and sale of various beauty, cosmetics, and personal care products manufactured in Korea. Geographically, the market is not limited to a specific region within Korea but has a significant presence throughout the country. Major cities such as Seoul, Busan, Incheon, and Daegu are prominent hubs for cosmetics manufacturing, distribution, and retail.\nKorea cosmetics market demonstrated a positive growth from 2022-2023, owing to country's long-standing beauty tradition that values skincare and self-care activities, rapidly expanding e-commerce sector, increasing purchasing power, growing consumer preference for natural products, increase in consumption of cosmetics among men & women, rise in adoption of do-it-yourself (DIY) beauty care trend, and Korea's increasing emphasis on research and development (R&D) activities.\nThe government heavily invests in scientific research, allowing cosmetic manufacturers to generate unique and effective treatments that address a wide range of skin issues. Also, K-beauty products are often packaged in visually appealing and cute designs. The attention to detail in packaging and the overall aesthetic appeal of K-beauty products add a sense of fun and playfulness to skincare routines.\nCompetitive Landscape:\nKorea cosmetics market is fragmented, with large number of companies, ranging from established brands to smaller regional players and niche manufacturers catering to the cosmetics demand. The number of brand companies grew from less than 1,000 in 2012 to nearly 30 thousand in 2022. In the domestic market, there is a huge shift from the previous channel dynamics during the mid-2010s, when brand companies had their own retail stores in the form of one-brand shops.\nWith the advent of Olive Young, a multi-brand store, came the division of brands and channels, giving smaller brand companies that may not have the equity and financial backing to be distributed by mainstream retailers (supermarkets or department stores) the ability to easily distribute their products. Moreover, on the production side, OEM/ODM companies like Cosmax and Kolmar Korea allowed smaller brands with lack of production capacity to produce high-quality and innovative products. The separation of distribution channel and production from brands propelled indie brand companies with unique ideas to succeed in the cosmetics market.\nKorean brands are losing out in the Chinese market to local brands in the mass segment and to global players in the premium segment, leading to inevitable and painful restructuring. However, Korean ODMs are more mass-oriented and are better exposed to outperforming local brands in China, which can result in positive continued order growth in the forecasted period. In particular, Kolmar Korea showed an impressive turnaround in its Chinese business on the back of its competitiveness in the sun care category.\nAfter full-reopening, the ODMs have expressed their urge for more aggressive marketing (Cosmax will set up new teams) for top-line expansion, and together with the Chinese brands customers' willingness for premiumization of product offering, it is expected to see double-digit top-line growth for ODM name.\nMarket Segmentation Analysis:\nThe report provides the bifurcation of the Korea cosmetics market into two segments based on type, namely, makeup and skincare. Skincare is the largest segment of Korea cosmetics market as a result of popularization of the multi-step skincare routine, high levels of awareness and demand for anti-aging products among the population, rising popularity of outdoor activities, increasing use of natural/organic and 'free from' formulations in Korean skincare, growing focus on personal appearance in Korea, and increasing demand for customized cosmetics.\nMakeup is the fastest growing segment of Korea cosmetics market owing to global popularity of Korean pop culture including K-pop and K-dramas, rising awareness of makeup among men, increasing female working population, strong focus of Korean companies on research & development in the cosmetics industry, growing awareness of the potential health benefits of using natural & organic cosmetics, and solid presence of domestic and international makeup brands.\nThe report provides the bifurcation of the Korea cosmetics market into two segments based on category, premium products and mass products. Premium is the largest and fastest growing segment of Korea cosmetics market owing to rising disposable income, increasing emphasis on self-care and beauty, established reputation of Korean brands for high quality and innovation, growing demand for personalized beauty solutions, long term benefits of premium products for the skin, and increasing focus on the use of premium natural and organic cosmetics.\nThe report provides the bifurcation of the Korea cosmetics market into five segments based on category, internet retailing, beauty specialist retailers, department stores, drugstores/parapharmacies, and others. Traditionally, cosmetics were mostly sold in grocery retailers (hypermarket and supermarkets) and department stores, where Korean players had difficulties penetrating into. However, the channel dynamics swiftly changed over the past decade with online and beauty specialist channels storming in to take larger shares as compared to 10 years ago.\nSuch a change in channel dynamics is beneficial for Korean players, allowing higher exposure to customers and lowering entry barriers. Internet retailing is the largest and fastest segment of Korea cosmetics market as a result of increasing popularity of online shopping, ongoing brand collaborations with social media influencers for digital marketing, increasing convenience of home delivery options, presence of well-developed e-commerce infrastructure, emergence of beauty mobile apps, and online retailers providing competitive prices and frequent promotions like discounts, flash sales, and coupons.\nThe report provides the bifurcation of the Korea cosmetics export market into six segments based on region, China, the US, Southeast Asia, Europe, Japan, and others. China held the largest share of Korea cosmetics market exports in 2023. K-beauty popularity has been also been gaining traction beyond China, with non-China exports rapidly growing, and major global cosmetics ODMs (original design/development manufacturer) are well positioned to ride the K-beauty 2.0 wave, and capture greater market shares, as ODMs have exposure to emerging brands that are successful in the US, Japan and ASEAN regions. Korean cosmetics have an edge in the skin care area, given, higher competition in the Korean market, and high demand for sensitive skin products among Korean consumers.\nMarket Dynamics\nGrowth Drivers\nGrowing E-Commerce\nIncreasing Popularity Of K-content\nGrowing Emergence of Smaller Brands\nRise Of ODMs\nIncreasing Influence Of Social Media\nChallenges\nHigh Competition\nGeopolitical Tensions With China\nMarket trends\nQuick Commerce\nRising Popularity of DIY\nPremiumization\nRising Augmented Reality Makeup Experience\nAI-Powered Personalization\nIncreasing Demand For Organic Cosmetic Products\nRise of Cosmeceuticals\nEthical and Sustainable Cosmetic Demand\nInnovation and the Development of New Cosmetic Products\nCompanies Featured\nAmorepacific Corporation\nCJ Corporation (CJ Olive Young Co., Ltd.)\nShiseido Company, Limited\nL'Oreal S.A.\nEstee Lauder Companies Inc.\nLG H&H Co., Ltd.\nClio Co., Ltd.\nKolmar Korea Holdings Co., Ltd.

    "text": "One of the most interesting things about having worked in the beauty industry for over 10 years has been bearing witness to the evolution of the beauty landscape. In the space of a decade, makeup looks have evolved from the full glam of the 2010s\u2014think contoured cheekbones, matte skin, and defined brows\u2014through to the current trend for fresh-faced and glowy clean girl makeup looks. In the same space of time, we've seen ingredient-led products take over our skincare shelves (in 2011, no one had heard of niacinamide or ceramides), and we've witnessed the rise and fall of chemical exfoliation\u2014now replaced with a fitting trend for skin barrier\u2013repairing products.\nWhen it comes to beauty products that go viral outside of wider trend movements, I've noticed an interesting cycle whereby the old becomes the new again. We're so used to perceiving new trends as newness that it's easy to forget that some products have been around for years and have been through previous phases of virality and success.\nIf, like me, your first introduction to the online beauty community was pre-TikTok and even pre-Instagram\u2014back in the day when you had to read a blog post or watch a YouTube video to follow a makeup tutorial or skincare routine\u2014then you've probably noticed some familiar faces popping up on your TikTok FYP. In recent years, as a new generation of beauty lovers have begun to swatch and share, iconic products have started to resurface, proving just how well they stand the test of time.\nFrom Embryolisse's Lait-Cr\u00e8me Concentr\u00e9 to Clarins's Lip Comfort Oils and Caudalie's Instant Detox Mask, you'll find some of the most coveted products of the moment on this list (many of which you will recognize from the past), and if you're browsing this list for inspiration, you'll also want to check out my predictions for products that could make a comeback in 2024.\n1. Caudalie Detox Mask\nCaudalie\nInstant Detox Mask\nCaudalie's Detox Mask was a beauty blogger favorite back in the day, and it's no wonder that it's made a comeback via TikTok. It works impressively fast, absorbing oil and highlighting exactly where your pores need some extra TLC. \n2. Embryolisse Lait-Cr\u00e8me Concentr\u00e9\nEmbryolisse\nLait-Cr\u00e8me Concentr\u00e9 Multi-Purpose Moisturizer\nThis cult moisturizer has made countless comebacks over the years. Any makeup artist will tell you that it's a staple in their kit\u2014perfect for nourishing and priming skin before foundation application.\n3. Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey\nClinique\nAlmost Lipstick in Black Honey\nThe original Clinique Black Honey launched in 1971, and in the decades since then, it's maintained a loyal following of devotees. Thanks to its ability to subtly enhance lips and suit all skin tones, it's recently undergone a resurgence in popularity, inspiring the creation of a softer shade, Pink Honey. \n4. Urban Decay 24/7 Moondust Eyeshadow in Space Cowboy\nUrban Decay\n24/7 Eyeshadow in Space Cowboy\nUrban Decay's Moondust eye shadows were first launch in 2013 but took 10 years to gain viral status. Described as a \"light champagne gold with silver sparkle,\" Space Cowboy is the perfect neutral shimmer for an easy party look.\n5. Olaplex No.3 Hair Perfector\nOlaplex\nNo. 3 Hair Perfector\nUsed in salons by professional hairstylists for decades, Olaplex No. 3 is the gold standard of reparative hair treatments. It works by rebuilding broken bonds in hair damaged by excessive heat styling and coloring. I remember No. 3 being impossible to get a hold of when it first launched to consumers, and thanks to the brand's constant virality on TikTok, it's a similar story in 2024.\n6. Clarins Lip Comfort Oil\nIt's no surprise that this iconic product has made a comeback given that lip oils are a key product in any clean girl makeup look. Glossy and nourishing but not sticky, Clarins's Lip Comfort Oils have been a staple in my makeup bag since they last trended in 2017. \n7. La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5\nLa Roche-Posay\nCicaplast Balm B5 Multi-Purpose Repairing Balm\nWhen it first launched in 2005, \"skin barrier\" was certainly not the buzzword it is now, but La Roche-Posay's Cicaplast Baume B5 quickly became one of the cult skincare products that bloggers picked up in their French pharmacy hauls. Now, the skin barrier is a major trend, and this product is right at the heart of it.\nThe beauty products we predict will make a comeback in 2024:\n1. Aesop Parsley Seed Cleansing Masque\nAesop\nParsley Seed Cleansing Masque\nThis cream is equal parts cleansing and nourishing, featuring aloe vera and parsley-seed extract that leave skin feeling smoother and brighter.\n2. La Roche-Posay Serozinc\nWhile La Roche-Posay is currently most known for its Cicaplast range, this face mist is not to be overlooked. Serozinc was a staple within acne-focused skincare routines of 2017, and in my opinion, it deserves the same hype in 2024. It utilizes zinc, an anti-inflammatory, to reduce the swelling and redness of breakouts.\n3. Antipodes Aura Manuka Honey Mask\nAntipodes\nAura Manuka Honey Face Mask\nAnother beauty blogger staple, Antipodes' Aura Manuka Honey Mask is still one of my all-time favorite face masks. It's perfect for skin that's experiencing acne breakouts while also contending with dryness and sensitivity\u2014the manuka honey soothes and calms skin.\n4. Eve Lom Cleanser\nCleansing balms have trended big time over the past few years, but let's not forget that Eve Lom's Cleanser was the original one. Thick, nourishing, and gently exfoliating, this is the ultimate treat for skin.\n5. Clarins Beauty Flash Balm\nClarins\nBeauty Flash Balm\nSeeing as multitasking skincare products are in, I'm surprised that Clarins's Beauty Flash Balm hasn't already made a comeback. Part mask, part moisturizer, and part primer, it smooths, nourishes, and gives skin a radiant glow.\n6. Nars Sheer Glow Foundation\nNARS\nSheer Glow Foundation\nOnce a holy grail because of its lightweight and easily layered formula in an era when natural-looking makeup reigns supreme, Nars's Sheer Glow really is the perfect base for a low-key makeup look. \n7. Dior Addict Lip Glow \nDior's lip products are always popular, but I'm ready and waiting for this color-enhancing lip balm to trend once again. Much like Clinique's Black Honey, it adapts to and enhances your natural lip color.\n8. Origins Drink Up Intensive Overnight Mask\nOrigins\nDrink Up Intensive Overnight Hydrating Mask\nEven after a decade, I've yet to find an overnight hydration treatment that works as well as this one. As a student, it was my go-to hangover mask because it would instantly restore brightness and moisture to my dehydrated skin, even after a late night.\n9. Kevyn Aucoin Sculpting Powder\nKevyn Aucoin\nThe Sculpting Powder\nContouring probably isn't top priority in your daily makeup routine in 2024, but that doesn't mean there isn't a place in your makeup bag for Kevyn Aucoin's Sculpting Powder. If you're after something to gently sculpt and define your features without looking orange or feeling heavy, this is it.\n10. Oskia Renaissance Cleansing Gel\nOskia\nRenaissance Cleansing Gel\nOskia's Renaissance Cleansing Gel was a holy-grail product 10 years ago, and its transformative gel-to-balm-to-milk texture will be right up your street if you like using gentle products to remove your makeup and cleanse skin.\n11. Missha M Perfect Cover BB Cream\nMISSHA\nM Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++ \nKorean beauty products are always trending, and for good reason\u2014they're packed with effective skincare ingredients and are almost aways focused on giving skin a glass-glow finish. If that's what you're after, then you'll love this weightless BB cream, which subtly tints skin while delivering powerful hydration.\nThis post originally appeared on Who What Wear UK."

Dave?\nDave Kimbell: Thank you, Kylie, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, with sales, operating margin, and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy, our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention. For the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales, and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share. Comparable sales increased 2.5% driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high team growth last year. A thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies, and new fulfillment and technology capabilities enabled our teams to deliver mid-single digit comp growth for the holiday period. Our holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. To support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling which inspired authentic connection, leading to record-breaking impressions, significant growth in shared voice, and strong social engagement. These successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing beautytainment to guests and building the basket. Compelling content combined with successful promotional strategies drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation while increasing shopping frequency and retention. From a market share perspective, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3rd, 2024, according to Circana data. Our market share of prestige Beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continued to face pressure from the expansion of beauty distribution points in prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term. Turning to performance by category. Skincare was our fastest growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like Bioma, Bubble, and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continued to appeal to consumers looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica, and Cetaphil. The fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Nuna's from Valentino, Burberry, and Tree Hut, and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites YSL, Gucci, and Billie Eilish, contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite, driving growth in the category. Top sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range. Softness and prestige Cosmetics were partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continued to resonate with beauty enthusiasts, and brands leaning into these trends, including Elf, Nyx, and exclusive brand Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth. While prestige Makeup was challenged in totality as we lacked strong growth last year, luxury brands Dior, Natasha Denona, and Pat McGrath continued to engage guests, and Hourglass Tard and Lancome saw success with compelling holiday offerings. Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the mid-single digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022. Products focused on styling and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands Redken, Kenra, and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with Way, Mielle, and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and Lola Bay also resonated with guests. Our services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. In addition to core styling services, specialty offerings, including extensions, hair treatments, textures, services, and ear piercing drove strong engagement with guests. Turning now to the full year, net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion, comp sales increased 5.7%, operating profit was 15% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touchpoints, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry. We launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beauty Counter, and Sol de Janeiro, and introduced emerging and exclusive brands, including Half Magic and Polite Society. We launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms. We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least one conscious beauty pillar and continued to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support. We expanded our Black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands, and welcomed the second cohort of BIPOC brands to our Muse Accelerator program, a program designed to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. Additionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refreshed the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives. Turning to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we improved the guest experience across all of our touchpoints. We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services while also introducing new members to our offering. And we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guests about new products, new techniques, and the latest beauty trends. We also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience. We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new, modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app, and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in ecommerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app. To support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities. We expanded same day delivery to all stores and increased our ship from store capabilities to 450 stores. Between focus, same day delivery and ship from store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year. Finally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations ending the year with 510 shops. And we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, re-engagement of lapsed guests and greater loyalty account linkage, as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community. Our marketing strategies, media investments and brand building efforts resulted in record level, unaided awareness, brand love and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched the Joy Project, a multiyear brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. We expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trend setting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment and share of voice. And we achieved an important milestone. In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty. With improved member retention, strong new member acquisition and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leading into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members. We are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them. Finally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products and launched an innovative omnichannel solution which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements, and deliver future profitable growth. I am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution Center, opened our Greer Market Fulfillment Center and began work on our Bolingbrook Market Fulfillment Center. We successfully transitioned our Jacksonville Greers and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform, and we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture while maintaining digital operations. We built a New Enterprise Data Platform on Google (NASDAQ:) Cloud Infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities, and we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. Our teams enable our success and we continue to invest and protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. This year we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession planning and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering and completed enterprise-wide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias. Associate retention improved across stores, distribution centers, and our corporate team. And our 2023 culture survey results reinforced that our overall associate engagement remains strong. Finally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofit, and energy management system upgrades and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the science-based target initiative. I am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace and I'm grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders, while also enabling new capabilities for future growth. As we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last three years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth, in 2024 we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid-single digit range, barring a major economic event. Beauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects, while also investing in core traffic and experience drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience. Starting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve, and expand all things beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. To strengthen our differentiated position, we'll continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury, while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced. In addition, this year we will refresh Ulta Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our Conscious Beauty platform and we will continue to enhance and amplify luxury at Ulta Beauty and across category platforms. Reflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touchpoints. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels, and relocations. In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment, and engaging services and events, while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization, and optimizing our store teams. We also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion, and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty and Target shops, evolve the assortment, and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies. Operating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement. To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify the JOY project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program. We will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition, while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement. We will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips and encourage omnichannel engagement, and we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media. Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts, in fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including project SOAR, digital store, and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new martech stack to support our personalization, retail media, and overall ecommerce efforts. Our supply chain optimization journey will continue. As our Bolingbroke Market Fulfillment Center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas Distribution Center, and we begin the retrofit of our remaining full service DCs in Chambersburg and Fresno. In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink. To protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhance associate learning and development and deepen our DEI impact. Turning to our final strategic pillar, we intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Building on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement our roadmap to achieve our emission reduction goals. Finally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the US. International expansion represents an incremental long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico. The Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing, and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly. And I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025. As a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024. For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023, while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities, and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates, and the communities we serve. Now, as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call, and I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. Now, today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1st. Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott?\nScott Settersten: Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. Financial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue and healthy traffic trends as well as strong execution and focused expense management. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.2% driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week were $181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions. Average ticket declined 1.9% driven by lower units per transaction which were partially offset by higher average selling price. Reflecting a more normalized pricing environment we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall increase. Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lapped the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated two, remodeled two stores and closed two stores. For the quarter gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales. The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates and leverage of supply chain costs which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin. Our efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions, and royalties earned through our Target partnership. At the same time, we realize benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality, as well as the impact from brand mix. These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year, but continues to be well below 2019 levels. Notably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor, and new fragrance fixtures. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points. Moving to expenses, SG&A increased 7.6% to $820 million. Overall SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses in store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. Incentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. In addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses, while store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleverages during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT capabilities, and UB Media. For the full year, we invested $62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024. Finally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives, as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. Operating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. To recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7% driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina, as well as the impact of product cost increases. Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders. In fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $178 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $124 million for IT, $73 million for supply chain, and $60 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $244 million compared to $241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352, 000 shares at a cost of $159 million, bringing total share repurchase to $1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning $5.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. Before I turn the call over to Paula, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty. It has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to pass the baton to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward.\nPaula Oyibo: Thank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of Chief Financial Officer at Ulta Beauty and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met. Before we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share two capital allocation updates. First, yesterday we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees but retained flexibility to upsize the capacity, if needed. Second, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024, we expect net sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures, and support core traffic and experienced drivers. In total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid-single digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue. Our assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share. We are planning EPS to decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single digit growth in the second half of the year. For modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margin. Finally, we plan to spend between $415 million and $490 million in CapEx, including approximately $270 million to $282 million for new stores, remodels, and merchandise fixtures, $120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT, and $45 million to $53 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $275 million and $280 million. We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We will share more of the logistical details later this summer. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. And also, Scott, best wishes in retirement. So I wanted to start out just with the prestige cosmetics category. As you look towards this fiscal year, we're seeing a lot of newness in storage. You're moving past, I think, pretty difficult comparisons. Just curious if you guys expect to return to share gains within the prestige cosmetics category.\nDave Kimbell: Rupesh, thanks for your question and thanks for calling out, Scott. Well deserved. Yes, I'll say on makeup and I'll even speak a little bit more broadly across all of our categories. We are focused on driving growth in every part of our business. Our makeup business in 2023 particularly in the second half, we saw healthy growth on the mass side and more challenges on the prestige side. So we have a strategy to drive performance within all parts of our makeup business. It is our largest segment and obviously important in the beauty category. Our efforts are holistic. We've got a number of new brands that we believe will either already are or will add value to the category, including the launch of Charlotte Tilbury, which just rolled out recently. Also, exclusive brands like Half Magic and Polite Society, Reven. Innovation from our existing big brands that we'll continue to see that have been so important to our business like Tarte and Benefit and Clinique and Lancome on the prestige side. Our luxury proposition really launched last year with a lot of success and as we continue to grow and build our presence in that space, we see that as a contributor. And then through our holistic efforts, we're going to try to find ways to lean in to the important trends. Makeup is, of course, has a key trend component. So whether it's blush, shade, proliferation, lip layering, matte makeup, nail is an important opportunity, we're going to continue to drive that. And the last thing I'd say is we continue to revamp and elevate our events that play an important role in mass migration. The number of mass consumers that we've acquired over the years, continuing to introduce them to prestige for the first time. So we're focused on driving that business. We are confident over time that we'll be able to deliver the growth that we expect, and we're working hard to deliver across all parts of that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler.\nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Hey, good afternoon, team. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. I'd like to touch a little bit on the decision to enter into Mexico. I mean, previously we'd been talking about potentially going into Canada. Just would like to understand your thought process of going or doing Mexico versus Canada, and what kind of opportunity do you really see there over the longer term? Thanks.\nDave Kimbell: Hey, I'm just going to say we're really excited about this announcement. And really, as I said in the prepared remarks, see Mexico as a great opportunity that's tailor-made for the Ulta Beauty experience. Kecia is leading this effort among many things that she does, so I'm going to ask Kecia to give some more color on it.\nKecia Steelman: Yes, absolutely. Well, after careful evaluation of many market opportunities, we really felt like the Mexican market is the next step for Ulta Beauty for us to have this partnership with Axo. I'm really excited about this. I know that the future is going to be really bright in this partnership. We spend a lot of time with their teams from a cultural perspective also, just even from the best-in-class performance with global partners that they've brought to the Mexico consumer, the Mexican consumer, our border stores are performing really, really well. And I just think it's the next natural step for us as we continue to expand internationally. So we are really excited about this. Again, we are planning to be operational in 2025. The cost of this is built into the guidance in \u201824, so we don't feel like it's very material, but we're super excited and feel that Axo is the right partner for us to launch in this next new territory for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon, team. This is Juliana on for Ike. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask in regards to thoughts on the beauty categories moving forward, particularly the brands of prestige and mass, and maybe in addition, how we can see that driving merchandise margin given benefit that we've seen. Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Well, for the overall category, as I mentioned in the remarks, we're fortunate to meet a category that continues to be healthy, that is highly connected to our consumers, a high level of engagement. There's an emotional connection that's driving the category and has been for a very long time and then certainly coming out of COVID has been exceptionally strong. All indicators as we look at the consumer landscape is continued level of engagement. When we look into this year, though, of course, we are evaluating and anticipating and preparing for consumer behavior to continue to evolve. We know there's external pressures on the consumer. We know we're entering into a dynamic time with an election year. And what we've seen in this category is strong growth, but as expected, some moderation in that growth, still above historical trends, but some moderation. Simply put, we think consumers are highly engaged in the category but still passionate about the category, but will continue to be thoughtful in all of their spending. But fortunately, we know that beauty is an important one. And as a reminder, Ulta Beauty is well positioned to manage through really any kind of economic disruption or challenge given our unique portfolio, all price points, all categories that allow us to meet our consumers' needs if there is a time that they feel more pressured or have other changes. But overall, category healthy. Paula, as it relates to any potential margin changes?\nPaula Oyibo: Yes, hi. What I would say is our merchandise margin, I would remind, we are meaningful and hopefully higher and better our merchandise margin since 2019. And really, that has a lot to do with we are a much healthier business now, and we have -- our mix in our business between our categories as well as prestige and mass through category performance efforts over the years has really helped us be able to be flexible as the consumer shifts between various categories as well as between mass and prestige. And so, we believe that we are able to manage that dynamic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity.\nSusan Anderson: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to maybe ask about the store expansion. It looks like it picks up a lot this year. I guess, how should we think about timing throughout the year? And then also, should we expect these to be the full-size stores, or are you going to roll out any of the smaller test stores that you've been looking at? And then also, just how do you think this helps to maybe win back some of the share from other competition? Thanks.\nScott Settersten: Thanks Susan. We are planning to open between 60 and 65 net new stores in fiscal 2024. That puts our growth between the two year period at 90 and 95 which is generally in line with the 100 that we had communicated, and so our thinking hasn't materially changed there. We remain confident in our ability to open and operate between 1, 500 and 1, 700 traditional Ulta Beauty freestanding locations in the U.S. and we're optimistic the small format store prototype could give us an opportunity for additional growth, as does the partnership with Target, and then similarly, as we're excited about the additional opportunity with our international expansion into Mexico. Related to the small geographies, we are planning to open 10 small store formats in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jeffries.\nAshley Helgans: Hi, thanks for taking our questions. So we just wanted to ask for an update on UB Media, anything you can share about the number of brands that are currently on the platform, maybe demand for the platform, and then any color to help us model at UB success scale? Thanks.\nDave Kimbell: Yes, we're really pleased with the progress that we've made as a reminder for those on the call. This really does represent a way for us to generate positive impact on our business by leveraging the first-party data and insights that we have in partnering with our brands. We're not sharing, we haven't shared, and we don't plan to share specific on number of brands or even specific financial impact at this time. But what I will say is we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in 2023 and are confident that we'll continue to grow this part of the business. The network that we have offers advertising access via off-site display, video, social influencers, as well as on-site sponsored products. Our on-site display inventory is one of the actually new core offerings that we activated just in 2023. So we've got a full suite of ad inventory experiences, value-added services, and as I said, we're confident in its impact going forward. And the support engagement reaction from brands has been very positive. As you know, the advertising world continues to evolve. So the value that we can bring through first-party data with 43 million beauty enthusiasts is very meaningful, and we continue to work with our brand partners, and they have demonstrated to us that they see a positive return and we're continuing to grow that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats Scott and looking forward to working with you Paula. I want to ask you a little bit about your thoughts on new product contribution this year because it does seem like certainly starting off with some momentum with Charlotte Tilbury and Sol de Janeiro, we did in store, Tarter in New York recently and the team is very energized around these brands. So I was wondering if you could talk about contribution this year versus previous years and then helping us understand, sort of, I think you might think you mentioned Sol de Janeiro that a portion of the doors maybe, can you give the same statistics for Charlotte Tilbury. And then on the margin, I would just love a little bit more detail in terms of what's driving the margin outlook to 14%, 14.3% end of the longer term range Whether there's anything sort of higher investment or what have you that sort of dragging that to that end of the range. Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Okay, thanks Olivia. Yes, I'll talk about new product at our newness pipeline and then Paula can pick up on your question around margins, so yeah, we're, well, first I'll say newness is always a critical part of our business and historically has been between 20% to 30% of our sales And that's an important part of the category and one of the best things about the category There is a large desire from our beauty enthusiasts guests from our members to discover what's new and exciting across all of our categories and so we do have what I believe is a well-balanced portfolio of new brands between big, recognized brands like Charlotte Tilbury, as well as a steady stream of emerging brands that are unique or exciting within the Ulta Beauty environment, and so we're not going to give any specific numbers about newness this year versus last year, but I will give you a couple of highlights. First, you mentioned Charlotte Tilbury, and just to reiterate, that is in 600 stores and online, and we're excited about that. It was one of the top requested brands from our members, and we're pleased to be partnering with them to bring a unique and powerful experience to life. The Sol de Janeiro is in 700 stores and also online, and also was highly requested and brings just a terrific experience in store and online and has been very well received since we launched that in January. But there's a whole range of products that we're going to continue to launch and bring to life. We do focus, as I said, on emerging brands. And while I'm not going to for competitive reasons share some of the pipeline that are ahead of us, I'd highlight some of the brands that we launched last year, like Lola Bay, Polite Society, Half Magic, a brand like Live Tinted, which has been with us for a little bit, important brands playing an exciting role in driving growth in various categories that we're excited about, and our luxury business that I talked about. We continue to add brands to that throughout the year and see growth. So newness important. We like the balance that we have. We're excited about the brands that we've launched so far, and I look forward to rolling out more partnerships and bringing newness across our portfolio throughout 2024. Paula, on the margin question?\nPaula Oyibo: Yes. So from an operating margin perspective, we share 14% to 14.3% of sales, and that is mostly deleverage coming from SG&A as we complete many of our foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, as well as we operationalize the investments that we made to date, and those go into one state. We also are managing ongoing wage pressures, which is assumed in a guidance, and we also will continue to support core traffic and experienced drivers. And so as you think about SG&A growth for the year, it will moderate into the high single digit range from the 12.5% growth we saw in fiscal 2023. And then we do expect gross margin to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleveraged from supply chain costs are partially offset by the growth we see and expect in other revenues.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with DA Davidson.\nMichael Baker: Okay, thanks. Really, just to follow up on what you just said, can you tell us where you are in this investment, in these foundational investments? I think you said $62 million in 2023, which was a blow plan and shift some into 2024. So what should it be in 2024? And even working backwards, can you remind us what it was in \u201821 in 2022, it was sort of supposed to be a three year investment plan that was rolling off. Sounds like it's still rolling off, although there'll be some lingering costs in 2024, so just trying to conceptualize what 2024 investments will look like versus 2023. Thank you.\nPaula Oyibo: Yes, Michael, I'll start with some of the numbers and then turn it over to Kecia so she can give a little bit more flavor for where we are. So we had incremental $55 million in 2022 related to our transformational strategic investments. We communicated $62 million incremental in 2023. As you think about 2024, we expect limited incremental investment as we complete the foundational elements of our transformational agenda. Think about project SOAR, Digital Store, and other IT projects. But as I communicated, once we completed those particular systems, these upgraded systems rolled into our core operations and become a part of our base and there's run cost associated with that. So there is run costs associated with those foundational investments. We will continue to invest to enable growth, as well as the other items that I mentioned regarding wage pressures in investing in traffic and experienced drivers. Kecia?\nKecia Steelman: Yes, so in regards to like where we are on the investments and where we are in the projects for our ERP upgrade or what we're internally calling as Project SOAR. Just this week, we completed our Dallas DC and we have plans to wrap up Greenwood and Fresno and open up our new MFC in Bolingbrook, which is a relocation of the existing FFC in Romeoville, all before peaks this year. Part of that ERP upgrade, we are also transitioning our store systems and our merchandising systems and we have those plans to be completed before the second half again prior to peak. For supply chain in \u201924, we're continuing to invest in our automation capabilities and I mentioned already the MFC and Bolingbrook hits on our supply chain lines and then also finishing out that retrofit in Dallas, the Dallas DC. And then for the digital store of the futures, a digital store platform we expect that to be completed in the first half of 2024 and we are wrapping up all of our upgrades around our analytical tools and reporting capabilities. So bottom line, we continue to be on track and on our budget and we are all in on wrapping these foundational enabling systems up this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes in the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.\nAnthony Chukumba: Thank you so much for taking my question and let me add my congratulations to Scott as well. It's been a pleasure working with you all these years. So my question was on the luxury brands. I guess just two parts to the same question both pretty quick. First off, how do they perform relative to your expectations in 2024, and what are your expectation in terms of additional luxury brand rollouts in 2023, and then what do your expectations for additional, luxury brand roll outs in 2024? Thank you.\nDave Kimbell: Great. Well, thanks for the question. Yes, luxury, as I said, was one of many initiatives last year to drive engagement, and we're really pleased with establishing that more firmly with some of our existing partners, including Chanel, but Dior, Natasha Denona, Pat McGrath and so we see strong performance and we're really pleased with how our guests are engaging in that part of the business. We had a lot of confidence going in because of existing relationships with brands like Chanel then by elevating and expanding it, it has really, we believe met our guest needs and they're excited about it and further demonstrates our ability to deliver all things beauty, from all price points, including luxury. We're not sharing any specific launches of anything beyond what I've already shared today. More broadly, as I said, with Nunu\u2019s, we have a steady stream of Nunu\u2019s throughout the year and we'll continue to innovate. Specifically within luxury, our focus is continuing to grow in partnership with the brands that we've launched and find new ways to expand those businesses and delight our guests with them. We're really pleased and proud to have that experience in our stores.\nKiley Rawlins: Operator, can we have the last question, please?\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.\nAdrienne Yih: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Scott, congratulations. It's been great and thanks for all the help over the years. This question is maybe for Dave or Kecia. Can you talk about the promotional environment that your guidance is under for 2024? Is it expected to sort of remain in maybe the first half and then abate or kind of pre-exist all year long and whether it was more from prestige? Are you concerned that there perhaps is a longer-term shift to mass or prestige from younger or more price-sensitive consumers? And then Scott and Paula, just a quick one. In your four to five comps, what are you expecting in terms of any ASP increases this year and what's the rationale behind the low single digit mid-single digit comp in the back half? What's going to drive the acceleration? Thank you very much.\nDave Kimbell: So, yes, just on the promotional environment, I probably won't answer every one of your detailed questions because we're not going to break it out that way exactly. What I'll say more broadly is we're not expecting that the promotional environment is going to significantly intensify and become irrational. We are in a competitive environment. That's for sure. And we are focused on ensuring that we're delivering on our leadership position. So as we look forward, we would anticipate and we have in our plans the ability to drive our business, which includes marketing, store labor, digital experiences, and promotional activity as appropriate. But not an expectation more broadly for a significant step. And we do anticipate, as we saw in 2023, that it will still remain well below 2019 levels. The mass to -- mass, prestige question. Yes, we see opportunity across both parts of the business. Yes, consumers are engaged, and young consumers are engaged in mass, but they're also engaged in prestige. They're loving our luxury experience. So it's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media. Those brands will win regardless of the price points. Paula, do you want to give a little color on some of the four to five?\nPaula Oyibo: Sure, and Adrienne, on your question with regards to expectation around ASP, what I would share is that we are planning for a more normalized pricing environment in 2024.\nDave Kimbell: Great, thank you. And thanks everyone for joining today. I'd like to close by thanking our 55, 000 associates for delivering a strong 2023. Together I know we will continue to unleash the unique power of beauty and keep moving our business forward in exciting ways. I'm optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty and confident we will continue to create significant shareholder value. I do want to take one second to thank Scott again. Scott, as I said, has been an amazing partner to all of us and I so appreciate his impact and his leadership. And I want to thank those on the call that had the chance to thank him yourself. I know he loved spending time in all of our meetings and all of our earnings calls. I know he appreciated partnership with all of you and I do want to thank Scott for everything you've done for our company. Thank you, Scott. We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on May 30th. Thank you again and have a great night.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Some key things you want to look out for are: Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, hydrating oils like rosehip or jojoba, and Vitamin C.

This is important to bear in mind, especially if your patches have stronger, more potent ingredients like collagen or caffeine. So put them on and then in 5-20 minutes you can take them off to revel a brighter, less puffy under eye area!\nShop Our Favorite Under Eye Patches \nDieux Eye Masks\nThese reusable, silicone eye masks are probably the most popular eye masks I've heard about in recent years. Since they're reusable they help to justify the price a bit. These eye masks have niacinimide which is going to be perfect if you're trying to combat any fine lines or hydrate your underage area. Since they're silicone, they're also super helpful in holding serums in place hence their re-usable nature.

It's said to boost your moisture and hydration levels by 200%! This is a holy grail and great to use every once in a while when you need something a little extra.\nPeter Thomas Roth 24K Gold Eye Mask\nTalk about 24K magic! These are also super popular. I've been using them for years because I genuinely noticed a difference in my underage brightness when I do.

They grew up in a world where a man\u2019s worth was measured not just by the size of his bank account, but by the cut of his suit and the shine of his shoes.\nThey learned the art of dressing from their fathers and grandfathers, who had in turn learned it from the British aristocracy they sought to emulate.\nThe Interwar Period and Post-War Elegance\nAs the Roaring Twenties gave way to the grim realities of the Great Depression and World War II, old money style evolved to reflect the changing times. The flashy excesses of the Jazz Age were replaced by a more sober, restrained aesthetic.\nSuits became more streamlined, colors more muted. It was a time of austerity and sacrifice, and old money style reflected that.\nBut as the post-war boom years kicked into high gear, old money style experienced a renaissance of sorts. The 1950s and early 1960s were a golden age of American prosperity, and the old guard of the East Coast elite were at the forefront of a new era of gentlemanly refinement.\nThe Golden Age for Old Money Style: The 1950s and 1960s\nThis was the era of the \u201cIvy League look,\u201d a style that combined the preppy polish of the East Coast elite with a dash of European flair. It was a time when every well-dressed man had a closet full of Brooks Brothers suits and a drawer full of monogrammed handkerchiefs.\nIcons like JFK and Cary Grant set the standard for old money style, effortlessly exuding an air of sophistication and charm. They wore their tailored suits and polished loafers like a second skin, making it look easy even as they worked tirelessly behind the scenes to maintain their image.\nModern Interpretations: The 21st Century Old Money Aesthetic\nFast forward to the present day, and old money style is experiencing something of a resurgence \u2013 albeit with a modern twist. In an era of fast fashion and disposable trends, there\u2019s a growing appreciation for the timeless elegance of classic menswear.\nBut today\u2019s old money aesthetic isn\u2019t just a carbon copy of the past. It\u2019s been updated for the 21st century, with a nod to contemporary sensibilities and a more relaxed approach to dressing. Think hybrid dress-sneakers paired with wool trousers, or a softly tailored blazer worn over a crisp white tee.\nDesigners like Ralph Lauren and Tom Ford have been instrumental in this evolution, offering collections that marry old-school craftsmanship with modern design elements.\nAnd as sustainability becomes an increasingly pressing concern, the old money ethos of buying less but buying better is resonating with a new generation of conscientious consumers.\nView More On Luca Faloni \nKey Components of Old Money Fashion for Men\nSo what are the building blocks of a quintessential old money wardrobe? Let\u2019s break it down:\nThe Tailored Suit: A Testament to Craftsmanship\nThe foundation of any old money closet is the tailored suit. This isn\u2019t your off-the-rack, polyester-blend number \u2013 we\u2019re talking bespoke, baby. A true old money suit is a work of art, crafted from the finest woolen cloth and cut to fit like a glove.\nSavile Row is the Mecca of old-school suiting, but Neapolitan tailors like Kiton and Attolini are also revered for their signature soft-shouldered, unstructured approach. The key is in the details: the hand-stitched buttonholes, the horn buttons, the full canvas construction that molds to your body over time.\nThe Oxford Shirt and Polo Shirt: Casual Refinement\nFor more casual occasions, the Oxford cloth button-down (OCBD) shirt is an old money staple. Originally designed for polo players who needed a collar that would stay put during matches, the OCBD has become a versatile wardrobe workhorse that\u2019s equally at home under a blazer or worn on its own with chinos.\nThe polo shirt, too, has its roots in the sporting life \u2013 tennis, in this case. But as with so many elements of old money style, it\u2019s been co-opted as a symbol of leisure-class ease. Look for versions in high-quality piqu\u00e9 cotton, with a trim (but not tight) fit and a crisp, tidy collar.\nLeather Loafers and Brogues: Footwear with Heritage\nOld money style is all about investing in quality over quantity, and nowhere is that more evident than in the realm of footwear. A well-made pair of leather shoes can last for decades if properly cared for, developing a rich patina that only gets better with age.\nPenny loafers and tasseled slip-ons are preppy classics that pair perfectly with everything from jeans to suit trousers. For a dressier look, opt for a traditional cap-toe Oxford or wingtip brogue in a deep chestnut brown or oxblood hue.\nView More On Void Watches \nAccessories in Old Money Fashion: The Finishing Touches of Elegance\nAccessories are the secret weapons of old money style \u2013 the cherry on top of the sartorial sundae, if you will. A well-chosen watch, a silk pocket square, a pair of tortoiseshell shades \u2013 these are the small but significant details that separate the men from the boys.\nTimeless Timepieces\nWhen it comes to watches, old money favors the classic and understated over the flashy and trendy. Brands like Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Jaeger-LeCoultre are perennial favorites, prized for their impeccable craftsmanship and storied histories.\nBut it\u2019s not just about the name on the dial. A true old money timepiece is often an heirloom piece, passed down from father to son over generations. It\u2019s a tangible link to the past, a symbol of continuity and tradition.\nElegant Cufflinks and Tie Accessories\nIn the world of old money style, even the smallest details matter. A pair of monogrammed cufflinks, a discreet tie bar, a collar pin \u2013 these are the subtle signifiers of refinement that separate the wheat from the chaff.\nLook for pieces in classic metals like gold, silver, and brass, with minimal embellishment. The goal is to add a touch of polish without veering into gaudiness.\nLeather Goods: Belts and Wallets\nAs with shoes, old money leather goods are all about quality and longevity. A well-made belt in a rich, supple leather is a must-have, as is a sleek wallet or card case.\nAvoid anything too trendy or over-designed; the beauty is in the simplicity. A plain leather billfold with a discreet monogram is the height of old money chic.\nScarves, Hats, and Eyewear\nThe finishing touches of an old money ensemble often involve a dash of sprezzatura \u2013 that inimitable Italian art of studied nonchalance. A jaunty silk scarf knotted just so, a panama hat tilted at a rakish angle, a pair of vintage-inspired sunglasses \u2013 these are the small but impactful details that take an outfit from good to great.\nThe Philosophy Behind Old Money Accessories\nAt the end of the day, old money accessories are about more than just looking good. They\u2019re a reflection of a certain worldview, a set of values that prioritize quality, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance over fleeting trends and conspicuous consumption.\nIt\u2019s a philosophy that says, \u201cI don\u2019t need to shout to be heard.\u201d It\u2019s a quiet confidence that comes from knowing who you are and what you stand for. And in a world that often feels like it\u2019s spinning out of control, there\u2019s something deeply reassuring about that kind of steadfast consistency.\nView More On Luca Faloni \nOld Money Hairstyles & Grooming Trends\nOf course, no discussion of old money style would be complete without a nod to the finer points of grooming. Because let\u2019s face it \u2013 you can have the sharpest suit and the shiniest shoes in the room, but if your hair is a mess and your breath stinks, it\u2019s all for naught.\nMen\u2019s Old Money Hairstyles\nWhen it comes to old money hair, the watchword is \u201cclassic.\u201d Think timeless, not trendy \u2013 a well-maintained side part, a neatly trimmed crop, a slicked-back style that oozes Mad Men-era sophistication.\nThe key is in the execution. Your hair should look effortless, as if you just rolled out of bed looking that good (spoiler alert: you didn\u2019t). A little pomade goes a long way \u2013 just enough to add shine and hold, without veering into helmet-head territory.\nOld Money Facial Hair\nAs for facial hair, the old money set tends to favor a clean-shaven look. It\u2019s crisp, it\u2019s polished, it\u2019s the epitome of gentlemanly refinement. That said, a well-groomed mustache or beard can work if it suits your personal style \u2013 just keep it neat and tidy, and resist the urge to go full lumberjack.\nWhether you go clean-shaven or opt for a little something, the most important thing is to keep your skin looking healthy and hydrated. A simple but effective skincare routine \u2013 cleanse, moisturize, protect \u2013 will go a long way towards achieving that old money glow.\nprinceandprincessofwales / Instagram \nMen\u2019s Old Money Style Icons\nEvery subculture has its heroes, and old money style is no exception.

How are those pores looking? Any bags under your eyes? Taken a wrinkle inventory lately?\nDon\u2019t answer that. Any of that. At least not before taking a spin through my top eight picks for the best face products for men. By the time you reach the end of this list, you\u2019ll be armed with the knowledge and products to combat any and all less-than-ideal areas of your visage.\nThe first thing you need to understand is that your face is a topographic enigma. Cracking its code takes trial, error, patience, rinsing, and repeating. Put another way, you\u2019ll need to experiment with several products catered to different areas of your face.\nChin up, though. Even if your skin care routine bobs and weaves from here, I\u2019m confident that this is a great place to start.\nFace washes. Lotions. Shaving creams. Under-eye repair products. All are present and accounted for. Now get out there and start experimenting, you face-conscious rascal.\nSorry for saying \u201cface-conscious rascal\u201d back there.\nKey Takeaways\nTo find the best face care products for men, I began by poring over dozens of products, reviews, ingredient lists, and even my own cache. The resulting eight products on this list are the best of the best based on factors that include but aren\u2019t limited to ingredients, uses, value for money, general skin feel, and overall efficacy.\nMy top overall pick among the best face products for men is Philosophy\u2019s Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser, which should be considered a staple in every man\u2019s bathroom. Close on its heels is my budget pick of CeraVe\u2019s AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion\u2014another must-have on your vanity.\n\nIn This Article \nOur Picks\nBuying Considerations\nHow We Chose\nWhy Trust Us? \nFinal Verdict\nFAQs\ngetjackblack / Instagram \nBest Overall: Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\nWhy it\u2019s great: Regardless of how \u201cfancy\u201d your arsenal of face products is, you\u2019re spinning your wheels if your routine\u2019s foundation isn\u2019t a quality facial wash. Philosophy\u2019s Purity Made Simple face wash is paraben- and phthalate-free, smells fantastic, and is free of harsh chemicals that could damage your skin over time.\nAdd an approachable price tag to this impressive roster of skincare benefits, and Purity easily finds its way onto my list of the best face products for men.\nWho it\u2019s for: Got a face? Great. This is for you.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Finding a negative to this product was an exercise in nitpicking. That said, some still may find its reasonable-yet-decidedly-not-cheap price tag a deterrent.\nItem Form: Liquid | Skin Type: Oily, Combination | Scent: Meadowfoam seed oil | Standout Features: Paraben-free, Phthalate-free, Meadowfoam seed oil\nBest For Lips: Jack Black Nightmode Lip Treatment\nWhy it\u2019s great: Which brings us, of course, to the Jack Black segment of our lineup. The Texas-based grooming product brand is a staple in many a man\u2019s arsenal.\nAnd lest you forget that your lips are a part of your face and also demand care and attention, allow me to remind you by way of Jack Black\u2019s Nightmode Lip Treatment. Its rich, moisturizing formula contains hyaluronic acid, manuka honey, chamomile butter, and other natural ingredients to hydrate dry lips throughout the night.\nWho it\u2019s for: Some guys can get away with the occasional ChapStick swipe and call it a day. Other guys (yours truly included) need something much more thoughtful, specially formulated, and effective. This is for the latter camp.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: By its very formulation and nature, Jack Black\u2019s Nightmode Lip Treatment doesn\u2019t make for a good everyday carry. It\u2019s one of the best face products for men, but it is also a niche product that\u2019s best left at home for pre-bed deployment.\nItem Form: Balm | Skin Type: Dry | Scent: Unscented | Standout Feature: Hyaluronic acid, cruelty-free\nBest Budget: CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30\nWhy it\u2019s great: CeraVe\u2019s AM face lotion is pretty much the total package in terms of the best face products for men. It\u2019s a budget-friendly, effective, oil-free, fragrance-free, ceramide-packed, daily-use facial moisturizer that also happens to protect your face from UV exposure. Slap on some of this SPF 30 goodness before heading out the door and you\u2019re good to go. I\u2019m partial to the \u201cslap\u201d technique, but I\u2019ll also accept \u201cgently apply.\u201d\nWho it\u2019s for: As evidenced by its over 62,000 5-star reviews on Amazon, CeraVe\u2019s AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion hits the sweet spot for most men\u2019s faces. It\u2019s an accessibly priced workhorse with more bells and whistles than you\u2019d expect from a product at this price point.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: A handful of reviewers complain of piling and clumping with frequent use. Thankfully, though, this is a wallet-friendly product that stands at the ready for some A/B testing.\nItem Form: Lotion | Skin Type: All | Scent: Unscented | Standout Feature: Hyaluronic acid, Niacinamide, Ceramides\nBest On Amazon: Lumin Smooth Operator Detox Trio\nWhy it\u2019s great: A charcoal face wash, a moisturizing balm, and a charcoal exfoliating scrub. Oh that? That\u2019s the all-star trifecta otherwise known as Lumin\u2019s Smooth Operator Detox Trio.\nLumin\u2019s products are formulated specifically for men\u2019s skin, and the ingredients that make up this trio of products were thoughtfully formulated to address signs of aging like wrinkles, puffiness, and the dulling of skin.\nWho it\u2019s for: The Detox Trio is definitely for all 3,500-plus people who gave it a 5-star review on Amazon. But if you\u2019re not one of them, just know that this outstanding skincare kit will be a solid fit for any guy who\u2019s intentional about how he takes care of his skin but isn\u2019t too fussy about it.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Committing to three products with one purchase isn\u2019t for everyone, even if it\u2019s the best face products for men. If you\u2019re more of a cherry-picker, you\u2019ll want to look elsewhere on my list.\nItem Form: Cream, Balm | Skin Type: All | Scent: Unscented | Standout Feature: Odor- and dye-free, paraben-free\nBest Everyday: Dove Men+Care Extra Fresh Body And Face Bar Soap\nWhy it\u2019s great: If singing a bar soap\u2019s praises from the rooftops is wrong, I don\u2019t want to be right. I\u2019ve been using this face and body soap from Dove Men+Care for years and have never come across its equal.\nFirst things first, the lather and foaming are exceptional. Definitely not what you\u2019d expect from an everyday drugstore bar soap. From there, the hits just keep on coming. It\u2019s cruelty-free, hydrates dry and sensitive skin, and is lightly yet noticeably scented in all the right ways. This is definitively one of the best face products for men.\nWho it\u2019s for: Body-wash purists and 10-step Korean skin care routine enthusiasts need not apply. But if you\u2019re already a bar soap guy or aren\u2019t opposed to trying a new (and inexpensive) product, you can\u2019t go wrong with this one.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: It\u2019s tough to argue with nearly 21,000 5-star Amazon reviews (and, ahem, my glowing review), but bar soaps (even the best face products for men) aren\u2019t for everyone. Then again, there\u2019s also a body-wash counterpart so\u2026 yeah, I hereby crown you a Dove Men+Care guy.\nItem Form: Bar | Skin Type: Sensitive, All | Scent: Extra Fresh | Standout Feature: Cruelty Free\nBest Starter Kit: Brickell Men\u2019s Daily Advanced Face Care Routine II\nWhy it\u2019s great: Portland, Maine-based Brickell Men\u2019s Products uses all-natural ingredients such as aloe, activated charcoal, hyaluronic acid, and green tea in its Daily Advanced Face Care Routine II kit. Wash, moisturize, scrub, rinse, repeat, accept praise and adoration until the end of time.\nWho it\u2019s for: If you\u2019ve thought about going all-in on a face care routine but either never got around to it or didn\u2019t know where to start, save yourself some trial-and-error and start here, with one of the best face products for men.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Similar to Lumin\u2019s trio of products, this skin care routine is an all-or-nothing proposition.\nItem Form: Gel, Cream | Skin Type: All | Scent: Unscented/Peppermint | Standout Feature: Certified organic\nBest For Shaving: Caswell-Massey Shaving Cream\nWhy it\u2019s great: Founded in 1752 (you heard me), Caswell-Massey is the oldest soap and fragrance company in America. \u201cBut Kelly,\u201d you ask, \u201cWas George Washington partial to the legendary company\u2019s Number Six fragrance?\u201d Ah, thought you\u2019d never ask. Yep.\nMoving on, Caswell-Massey\u2019s shaving cream is paraben-, phthalate-, and sulfate-free and has been formulated to lift and separate hairs to ensure the smoothest possible shave.\nWho it\u2019s for: Fancy yourself a shaving-product connoisseur? Caswell-Massey\u2019s shaving cream is about as thick, luxurious, and storied as it gets.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Unless you\u2019ve got the budget to make this an everyday shaving cream option, you\u2019ll likely find its size and longevity limited.\nItem Form: Cream | Skin Type: All | Scent: Almond, Number Six, Woodgrain Sandalwood | Standout Feature: No parabens, sulfates, or phthalates\nBest Luxury: Blu Atlas Restorative Eye Stick\nWhy it\u2019s great: Putting any Blu Atlas product in the \u201cluxury\u201d file is tricky. All the touchstones of luxury are there: Thoughtfully packaged products. Paraben-, cruelty-, sulfate-, and phthalate-free ingredients. Vegan formula. It goes on.\nBut perhaps surprisingly, you\u2019re working with competitive prices as well. The New York-based company\u2019s Restorative Eye Stick helps combat dark, puffy under-eye circles by way of natural ingredients like Vitamin C, algae extract, and caffeine.\nWho it\u2019s for: Maybe you suffer from seasonal allergies. Maybe you\u2019re a man of a certain age and gravity\u2019s doing its gravity thing. It doesn\u2019t matter how dark lines or under-eye bags occur\u2014if you\u2019re got them, this powerful, portable stick is for you.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Though few and far between, some reviewers of this product complain of a burning sensation and limited efficacy.\nItem Form: Liquid | Skin Type: Sensitive, All | Scent: Unscented | Standout Feature: Paraben-free, Phthalate-free, Cruelty-free, Sulfate-free\nbrickellmensproducts / Instagram \nBuying Considerations For the Best Face Products for Men\nIngredients\nThe best face products for men are the ones that incorporate all-natural ingredients and avoid parabens and sulfates. The presence of the former and the absence of the latter promote healthier skin and moisturize without causing irritation.\nHeavily fragranced formulas can also irritate sensitive skin, so be sure to factor that into your ingredient considerations.\nSkin Type\nNot all of the best face care products for men are created equal. This is especially true when it comes to which ones are best for specific skin types. If you have acne or dry skin, for example, you\u2019ll want to prioritize products catered to addressing those specific conditions.\nThere\u2019s a face product out there for every skin type, so don\u2019t skimp on the research when choosing the right one for you.\nRoutine\nThere\u2019s a product out there (nay, hundreds of products) for every inch of every face, regardless of your skin type and unique needs. Honing in on the right lineup for you depends on your specific grooming routine and which areas of your face you want to prioritize.\nTo help you navigate your seemingly endless options of the best face products for men, start by researching things that align with your particular grooming routine and target areas. Or just follow my lead and call it a day.\nlovephilosophy / Instagram \nHow We Chose\nAs a fashion and grooming writer at FashionBeans, I compare, test, and research the products that make a gentleman a gentleman. If it can be worn, carried, or used in a way that elevates your look and feel, I\u2019m into it.\nFor this review, I pored over trusted sources, customer reviews, ingredient specifications, and my own experience to understand what makes the best face products for men. After comparing more than 50 products, the resulting eight are what I\u2019m calling the best of the best. Some of my key considerations include:\nPurpose: \u201cFace products\u201d is a very broad stroke. That in mind, I made every effort to prioritize versatile products with universal functionality. Face washes and moisturizers are cornerstones of every men\u2019s grooming routine, but sleeper products like lip balms and shaving creams also deserve their time in the sun.\nCustomer Reviews: I read through dozens of product reviews in search of both positive and negative throughlines before citing various perspectives throughout this list.\nPrice: Yes, you need your face products to work, but you also need the expense to make sense for your current financial situation. With the selection of incredible products on the market today, there\u2019s no need to overpay for anything. I kept that consideration top of mind when choosing the best face products for men. \nWhy Trust Us?\nWhen it comes to deciphering the essence of style and grooming, Kelly Larson stands out as a beacon of expertise. He has a prolific 12-year tenure in the fashion and grooming industry, and his insights are not just words on a page\u2014they are a compass for those seeking guidance in a sea of trends.\nWitness his detailing of the best casual shirts and the best Diesel colognes.\nTo compile this list of the best face products for men, Kelly went the hard yards so you don\u2019t have to, sifting through a myriad of industry and reviewer information and also using his trial-and-error learnings to inform the content.\nFinal Verdict \nThe best face products for men are made with quality, lightly scented, natural ingredients. And if they happen to be free of parabens, sulfates, and other ingredients that may damage or irritate your skin, all the better.\nYou\u2019ve got plenty of options, but it behooves you to start your routine with my top overall pick of Philosophy\u2019s Purity one-step facial cleanser.\nFAQ\nThe foundation of every face-grooming routine is overall cleanliness. That in mind, the best face product for men based on my extensive research is Philosophy\u2019s One-Step Facial Cleanser. Value-conscious and made with natural ingredients, it should be considered a staple in every man\u2019s self-care regimen.\nBe it oily, dry, sensitive, or \u201cnormal,\u201d it all depends on your skin type. If you\u2019re looking for a catchall, crowd-pleasing profile, look for lightly scented products made with all-natural ingredients that are free of sulfates and parabens.\nMost men wash their face with either bar soap, body wash, or face wash. It depends on your specific skin type, but your safest overall bet is going with a lightly scented face wash derived from natural ingredients."

Face washes. Exfoliating body washes. Eye creams. Anti-aging products. Anything and everything else that has to do with making the human body look, smell, and feel better. It\u2019s a lot.\nSo today, I aim to detangle that self-care web by taking a deep dive into the top men\u2019s grooming products across 25 categories.\nOh, you know I\u2019ll be talking shampoo. Sunscreen? Don\u2019t even get me started. We\u2019re even going to dip a collective toe into mouthwash and toothpaste territory. You heard me. At the very least, I\u2019m hoping this list will help you cobble together a respectable, if not outstanding, cache of everyday grooming essentials.\nReady to look good, feel good, and maybe even reckon with the occasional hairdryer? All right then, let\u2019s get into it.\nKey Takeaways\nTo find the best men\u2019s grooming products across 25 cross-niche categories, I began by poring over dozens of products, reviews, ingredient lists, and even my own cache of everyday essentials.\nThe resulting products on this list are the best of the best based on factors that include but aren\u2019t limited to ingredients, uses, value for money, general skin and hair feel, and overall efficacy.\nSince every man needs a good shampoo in his arsenal, my top overall pick is Brickell\u2019s Daily Strengthening Shampoo. On its heels is another essential\u2014Bevel\u2019s natural, sulfate-free conditioner.\n\nIn This Article \nOur Picks\nBuying Considerations\nHow We Chose\nWhy Trust Us? \nFinal Verdict\nFAQs\nbrickellmensproducts / Instagram \nBest Men\u2019s Shampoo: Brickell Daily Strengthening Shampoo\nWhy it\u2019s great: Born in its namesake Miami neighborhood, Brickell now manufactures its men\u2019s skin- and hair-care products in South Portland, Maine using 100% renewable energy to reduce its carbon footprint and offset its electricity consumption. Good. Great. Fine.\nBut what\u2019s in it for your hair? Brickell\u2019s Daily Strengthening Shampoo is made with natural ingredients that won\u2019t damage your hair or strip it of its natural oils, even with frequent use. And those with dry or sensitive scalps will appreciate the incorporation of peppermint and tea tree oils.\nWho is this for? This is one of those unicorn-adjacent shampoos that can do no wrong. It smells fantastic. The ingredients are natural. And it\u2019s ideal for guys with normal, sensitive, or dry skin. In short, it\u2019s one of the best men\u2019s grooming products you\u2019ll find.\nBonus: Brickell will send you 16 sample-size products to test out for free, with the shampoo being one of them. You\u2019ll still need to pay for shipping, but it\u2019s a generous and super helpful offering that\u2019s not common among competitors.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: If you\u2019re just beginning the trial-and-error phase of your shampoo journey, you\u2019ll likely find Brickell\u2019s price point a bit steep for your liking. If you\u2019re on the tail end of said journey\u2014don\u2019t think too hard about it and just get in there.\nBest Men\u2019s Conditioner: Bevel Conditioner\nWhy it\u2019s great: Fortified with coconut oil and shea butter, Bevel\u2019s conditioner is as gentle as it gets. This is one of the best men\u2019s grooming products you can get. The sulfate-free formula helps retain your hair\u2019s natural oils and leaves your locks smelling and feeling amazing.\nWho is this for? Even though Bevel\u2019s sulfate-free, hydrating formula was created with textured hair in mind, its gentle ingredients translate well to any hair and scalp type.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Bevel Conditioner reviews are overwhelmingly positive. That said, a handful of dissatisfied reviewers complain that its scent is too strong and cologne-like. If you\u2019re looking for a gently scented or unscented product, this won\u2019t be the right fit.\nBest Face Wash: Every Man Jack Daily Face Cleanser\nWhy it\u2019s great: Every Man Jack\u2019s Daily Face Cleanser is one of the more recent additions to my daily skincare routine, and so far I\u2019ve been impressed with how gentle and unobtrusive this formula is.\nThis budget-friendly, paraben- and phthalate-free face wash is fortified with hyaluronic acid, jojoba oil, caffeine, and other natural ingredients that won\u2019t dry out or irritate your skin.\nWho is this for? This is a fragrance-free formula that doesn\u2019t use any harsh chemicals or ingredients, making it a great go-to for any guy with any skin type.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: I\u2019ve historically used only soaps and face washes with, at the very least, a light scent. I also love a good lather. Although Every Man Jack\u2019s face wash lacks both, I can\u2019t argue with how good it makes my face feel after every use.\nBest Men\u2019s Body Wash: Aesop Geranium Leaf Body Cleanser\nWhy it\u2019s great: Aesop is all about formulating products that are equal parts luxury and function. And it doesn\u2019t miss. Case in point: the London- and Melbourne-based brand\u2019s Geranium Leaf Body Cleanser. Yet another super gentle, low-foaming formula, its main ingredients are geranium leaf, bergamot rind, and mandarin rind.\nWho is this for? Get-in-and-get-out showerers need not apply. The fresh, invigorating scent of Aesop\u2019s body wash coupled with its silky feel will be best appreciated by guys who view showering as a self-care ritual as opposed to a necessary evil.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: This is one of the best men\u2019s grooming products out there. However, as with any luxury product worth its salt, you\u2019re going to pay a premium for this bottle.\nBest Men\u2019s Soap: Dove Men+ Care Body and Facial Cleanser\nWhy it\u2019s great: All right dammit, hear me out. I\u2019ve made every effort to keep this list of the best men\u2019s grooming products as diverse as possible. Elevated, spa-worthy soaps. Down-and-dirty drugstore hair products. You name it.\nI\u2019ve tested a lot of products throughout the years. A lot. And for the life of me, I just can\u2019t quit Dove Men+ Care\u2019s bar soap. For starters, the lather can\u2019t be beat. Beyond that, the cruelty-free formula has no business leaving my skin as soft and moisturized as it does. Smells nice, too. Anyway, yes, bar soap.\nWho is this for? We\u2019re guys. Yes, we like to elevate our grooming routine from time to time. Stop and smell the vetiver and all that. But at the end of the day, all we really want is to be clean, feel good, and get that way with as little fuss as possible. Enter: this.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: I mean, it\u2019s bar soap. It\u2019s not for everybody.\nBest Men\u2019s Razor: Bolin Webb Generation Razor\nWhy it\u2019s great: Does anyone really need a meticulously designed, weighted razor handle made of machined aluminum that\u2019s for-some-reason outfitted with a Gillete cartridge razor? Of course not. But I\u2019ll be damned if this impossibly handsome, improbably durable, perfectly giftable unit from Bolin Webb doesn\u2019t make a good case in favor.\nWho is this for? Your dad who has everything. Your discerning brother. Your neighbor who had no idea he needed an over-the-top everyday razor. This is one of the best men\u2019s grooming products for those guys and so many more.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: See above? See above.\nBest Men\u2019s Electric Shaver: Braun Series 9 9370cc\nWhy it\u2019s great: Running the gamut from budget to splurge-worthy, Braun\u2019s suite of electric shavers is nothing short of impressive.\nPiling on is the German brand\u2019s Series 9 9370cc electric shaver\u2014an absolute unit of a product with five shaving elements, a 10-direction head to adapt to the contours of your face, 100% waterproof construction, and a cordless shaving time of just below an hour.\nWho is this for? This is the electric shaver you turn to when you\u2019ve tried the budget options and are finally ready to close the trial-and-error chapter of your grooming-routine journey.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Several Amazon reviewers were disappointed when the Series 9 didn\u2019t perform as well as their straight razor or safety razor did. Although they were generally satisfied, it should go without saying that an electric razor is never a match for its analog counterpart.\nBest Men\u2019s Aftershave: Bevel Post-Shave Balm\nWhy it\u2019s great: Bevel makes the list for a second time with its gentle, nutrient-rich post-shave balm. Jojoba oil, tea tree oil, shea butter, and other natural ingredients combine forces to create a soothing, invigorating aftershave balm to help your skin bounce back after your daily or weekly shave.\nWho is this for? Bevel\u2019s products are specifically formulated with textured hair in mind. As such, it\u2019s more than capable of soothing and rejuvenating all scalp and hair types.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Even though the scent is subtle, it\u2019s still very much there. Figure out if you\u2019re a scented or unscented guy before deciding for or against this shave balm.\nBest Men\u2019s Cologne: Creed Aventus\nWhy it\u2019s great: Creed Aventus is one of the most long-lasting and universally loved colognes out there, and for good reason.\nIt opens with vibrant, fruity notes that give way to heartier fragrances of patchouli and jasmine before closing with rich sandalwood, oakmoss, and vanilla. Spritz some on in the morning and you\u2019re good for the rest of the day.\nWho is this for? Aventus is one of those fragrances that you could use as your everyday go-to or keep on the shelf until a special occasion rolls around. Either way, it\u2019s ideal for the guy who\u2019s been through the rest and knows a damn good bottle when he sees one.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: This is definitely one of the best men\u2019s grooming products you can get. However, if you\u2019re new to cologne or are still trying to find your ideal scent, then you may find the high price point of this cologne to be a deterrent.\nBest Men\u2019s Hair Paste: American Crew Defining Paste\nWhy it\u2019s great: American Crew\u2019s Defining Paste is another product I\u2019ve been using for years. For me, this is one of the best men\u2019s grooming products.\nMy hair is straight and thin, making it the perfect candidate for this paste that holds firm and doesn\u2019t let up throughout the day. Aside from its vice grip, another one of my favorite attributes of this workhorse hair product is its barely noticeable matte finish.\nWho is this for? I\u2019m a guy with super thin, super straight hair, and American Crew\u2019s Defining Paste is one of the few products I\u2019ve had success with. If you\u2019ve got natural curls, waves, or otherwise thick and textured hair, you may not need a paste this strong.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Paste isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s thing. Though I\u2019ve had a great experience with this product, it skews niche and won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea.\nBest Men\u2019s Hair Gel: Tea Tree Firm Hold Gel\nWhy it\u2019s great: Unlike my personal choice of a strong paste, gel is one of the more universally liked hair products. And Tea Tree\u2019s Firm Hold Gel is at the top of its game within the category. This vegan, paraben-free gel incorporates Australian tea tree to create a firm, long-lasting formula that leaves behind a light scent of mint and citrus.\nWho is this for? Unfussy guys looking for an outstanding everyday gel made with natural ingredients will appreciate the effective simplicity of this product from Tea Tree.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: A vocal minority of Amazon customers complain of a weaker hold than they were expecting\u2014likely the result of the product not being a good fit for their hair type. If you have longer, thin hair, then you\u2019ll often find better results from using a paste or pomade.\nBest Men\u2019s Dry Shampoo: R+Co Badlands Dry Shampoo Paste\nWhy it\u2019s great: Though I\u2019m still working on this myself, washing your hair every day is not typically recommended. Enter: dry shampoo.\nMore specifically, R+Co\u2019s Badlands Dry Shampoo Paste. It works as both a texture- and volume-adding styling agent and dry shampoo. The vegan, paraben-free, sulfate-free formula gives new life to second-day hair.\nWho is this for? If you don\u2019t wash your hair every day and use a gel or paste to give it some much-needed second-day volume, this is a way to do it without introducing an oily product that can build up over time.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: If you\u2019re like most guys, myself included, introducing yet another hair product into the daily rotation can be a tough sell. But if you\u2019ve got the time and don\u2019t want to pile multiple oily products on top of one another, then this is a solid option.\nBest Men\u2019s Grooming Product For Thinning Hair: Hims Thick Fix Shampoo\nWhy it\u2019s great: Hims\u2019 Thick Fix Shampoo is by no means a miracle cure for thinning hair\u2014nor is it designed to actually stimulate hair growth. What it will do, however, is help maximize the health and volume of the hair you already have.\nIt incorporates saw palmetto which helps reduce scalp buildup, and its refreshing eucalyptus scent will keep you feeling fresh throughout the day.\nWho is this for? Though Thick Fix is meant for guys with thinning hair, it will also help promote scalp health and hair volume if you\u2019re already working with a full mane.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Some customers have complained of limited efficacy. It bears repeating that although this product is made with quality ingredients, you can expect only so much from a shampoo in general.\nBest Men\u2019s Hairdryer: BaBylissPro Nano Titanium\nWhy it\u2019s great: Hairdryers run the gamut in terms of price, quality, and the hair types they\u2019re best suited to. It\u2019s anything but a one-size-fits-all product, but the BaBylissPro Nano Titanium comes pretty close. This sleek, 2,000-watt machine is suitable for all hair types thanks to its even heat distribution and powerful motor.\nWho is this for? The Nano Titanium will be a good fit if you appreciate the not-so-subtle differences between a bad hairdryer and a good one\u2014namely the fact that you don\u2019t have to replace the latter every few months.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Not every guy blowdries his hair every day. If you do, then this\u2019ll be worth the investment. If not, save your money and get a product a few tiers down.\nBest Men\u2019s Sunscreen: Oars + Alps SPF 37 Everyday Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer\nWhy it\u2019s great: Hyaluronic acid. Vitamins E and B5. SPF 37. Still not sold on Oars + Alps anti-aging daily moisturizer? Okay. It\u2019s vegan, paraben-free, sulfate- and phthalate-free, and incorporates ingredients like Alpine Caribou Moss which are rich in antioxidants. It won\u2019t leave an oily finish on your face and it\u2019s gentle enough for everyday use.\nWho is this for? Oars + Alps\u2019 gentle formula helps tighten aging skin and keeps harmful UVA and UVB rays at bay with SPF 37 protection.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Since this moisturizer incorporates SPF 37, you can expect a thick, white consistency that\u2019s not unlike a sunscreen. A handful of dissatisfied reviewers were expecting a thinner consistency and a more luxurious feel.\nBest Men\u2019s Hand Cream: Gold Bond Healing Hand Cream\nWhy it\u2019s great: Every time the temperature dips below 40-degrees or so, my hands inevitably lose the will to live and descend into dry, cracked darkness. After trying what feels like everything, I finally discovered Gold Bond\u2019s Healing Hand Cream and haven\u2019t looked back since.\nIt\u2019s one of the best men\u2019s grooming products I\u2019ve found. This stuff is the real deal and works wonders for hands. Seven moisturizers, three vitamins, aloe, and other ingredients combine forces to obliterate dryness and discomfort.\nWho is this for? This is a super thick, super effective product that\u2019s best for those with dry, cracked skin.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: If you have normal skin that\u2019s not routinely prone to over-drying, the thickness of Gold Bond\u2019s Healing Hand Cream might feel like overkill.\nBest Men\u2019s Deodorant: Oars + Alps Aluminum-Free Deodorant\nWhy it\u2019s great: Oars + Alps is back on top, this time with its Aluminum-Free Deodorant. As with other products from the Chicago-based brand, this deodorant is free from alcohol, parabens, and phthalates and is vegan and cruelty-free. Oh, and it works. Key feature, that.\nWho is this for? Drugstore-product aficionados need not apply. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you\u2019ll find some quality deodorants there, but nothing of this caliber.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Although this aluminum-free deodorant\u2019s scent is anything but overbearing, it does have notes of lime, cedarwood, and greens, which won\u2019t appeal to guys looking for unscented or lightly scented deodorants.\nBest Men\u2019s Body Lotion: Kiehl\u2019s Cr\u00e8me de Corps\nWhy it\u2019s great: Heritage brand Kiehl\u2019s has been part of the conversation since its inception as an apothecary in 1851. Fast forward over 170 years and here we are talking about the Manhattan-born brand\u2019s Cr\u00e8me de Corps.\nIt\u2019s a thick, hydrating body lotion that combines cocoa butter and shea butter in a way that coats the skin without feeling oily or looking shiny.\nWho is this for? As a guy with dry, sensitive skin, I naturally gravitate toward products like this. Why? Because they work. The kicker: most of them leave a shiny, heavy-feeling residue behind. Ever the contrarian, Kiehl\u2019s Creme de Corps absorbs quickly and leaves no evidence other than smooth, moisturized skin.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: This is a thick, rich, workhorse of a lotion that does its job and does it well. That\u2019s it. Look elsewhere if you\u2019re more interested in a scented, spa-adjacent product.\nBest Men\u2019s Grooming Product For Acne: La Roche-Posey Dual Action Acne Treatment\nWhy it\u2019s great: Unlike lesser acne treatment creams, La Roche-Posey\u2019s Dual Action Acne Treatment won\u2019t dry out your skin. Its infusion of benzoyl peroxide to fight acne and glycerin to promote hydration work alongside an exfoliant that lets the good stuff in and keeps the bad stuff out.\nWho is this for? If you haven\u2019t had any luck with drugstore anti-acne brands or if traditional options tend to dry out your sensitive skin, then you\u2019ll likely experience better results with La Roche-Posey.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: If you don\u2019t have sensitive skin, you won\u2019t have a hard time finding less pricey acne-fighting products out there.\nBest Men\u2019s Shaving Cream: Proraso Refreshing Shaving Cream\nWhy it\u2019s great: Proraso\u2019s Italian-made shaving cream is a paraben-, phthalate-, and cruelty-free product with a thick, luxurious feel. Gentle, soothing eucalyptus oil makes it suitable for all skin types. Meanwhile, the incorporation of menthol leaves behind a refreshing scent and invigorates the skin.\nWho is this for? This is one of the best men\u2019s grooming products. If you view shaving as a ritual instead of a job, then Proraso\u2019s Refreshing Shaving Cream is for you.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: This is a gentle formula made of 91% natural ingredients. But if you have extra-sensitive skin or are generally averse to fragranced products, then the menthol scent may be a turn off.\nBest Men\u2019s Beard Oil: Cremo Cedar Forest Beard Oil\nWhy it\u2019s great: Got a beard? Oh, great. Is it itchy? Of course it is. Turns out, you\u2019re in the right place, because here comes Cremo\u2019s Cedar Forest Beard Oil in all its soothing, masculine-scented glory.\nArgan oil: Check. Jojoba oil: Check. A bunch of other oils that work wonders for thick beards: As much as I\u2019d love to pop a plot twist in here\u2026\nWho is this for? This extra rich formula from Cremo is for guys with thick, dare I say unruly, facial hair. It\u2019s packed with ingredients designed to target and tame coarse, dry hair.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: If you\u2019re researching the best men\u2019s beard products, chances are you\u2019ve already got an arsenal of products on standby\u2014some of which are scented. It\u2019s worth noting that Cremo\u2019s beard oil features a prominent cedar fragrance that, for better or worse, will inevitably end up competing with those products.\nBest Men\u2019s Toothpaste: Crest 3D White Advanced Toothpaste\nWhy it\u2019s great: Look, it\u2019s toothpaste. It needs to work. It needs to leave your teeth feeling clean and your breath smelling fresh. Is there anything else? Probably, but the fancy-pants-toothpaste rabbit hole is real and it\u2019s deep.\nSo for now, let\u2019s just focus on Crest\u2019s 3D White Advanced Toothpaste\u2014a budget-friendly essential that does its job and does it well. Put another way, I\u2019ve been using it for over a decade and have yet to piss off my dentist.\nWho is this for? The everyday guy with everyday teeth. I could go on but\u2026 no I couldn\u2019t.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: I use and like this toothpaste. This toothpaste has nearly 75,000 5-star reviews on Amazon. I\u2019m sure this toothpaste has flaws, but I ran out of patience trying to find them. Do with that what you will.\nBest Men\u2019s Toothbrush: Oral-B CrossAction All-In-One Toothbrush\nWhy it\u2019s great: A toothbrush. That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s really all this is. And as fate would have it, that\u2019s really all you need. But if you\u2019re going the manual route, there\u2019s a few things you need to look for.\nThe toothbrush should be sturdy and feel comfortable in your hand. Its bristles shouldn\u2019t be too hard or too soft. And all the better if it has thoughtful included details like gum stimulators and a tongue-and-cheek cleaner. The Oral-B CrossAction All-in-One Toothbrush checks all those boxes and then some.\nWho is this for? The get-in, get-out guy who wants an outstanding toothbrush but doesn\u2019t need any bells or whistles to get the job done. This is one of the best men\u2019s grooming products for that guy. Is it you?\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: You\u2019ll generally get a more thorough brushing with an electric toothbrush for a handful of reasons. But for manual-toothbrush purists, this is one of the best and most effective options out there.\nBest Men\u2019s Electric Toothbrush: Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 5100\nWhy it\u2019s great: As a reformed manual-toothbrush user turned Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 5100 evangelizer, I feel uniquely qualified to sing this machine\u2019s praises. Between the two-minute brush timer, pressure sensor, and three brush modes\u2014Clean, White, and Gum Care\u2014it\u2019s the toothbrush version of autopilot.\nWho is this for? If you\u2019re thinking about switching from a manual brush to an electric, first off, then good on you. Secondly, skip your own trial-and-error and let me save you some trouble: This. Just get this.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: There are cheaper electric-toothbrush options out there, sure, but you get what you pay for.\nBest Men\u2019s Mouthwash: TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse\nWhy it\u2019s great: TheraBreath mouthwash is an effective alternative to the more ubiquitous, harsher products that tend to burn. The formula doesn\u2019t contain alcohol and has a gentle, refreshing menthol flavor. Not to mention it has over 35,000 5-star reviews on Amazon.\nWho is this for? Anyone who\u2019s fed up with the harsh taste and dry-mouth feel of Listerine and similar products.\nFlaws but not deal-breakers: Since this is a non-burning formula, there\u2019s a bit of a mental learning curve here since many people associate a burning mouthfeel with general efficacy.\nbevel / Instagram \nBuying Considerations For The Best Men\u2019s Grooming Products\nIngredients and Materials\nThe best men\u2019s grooming products (in terms of skincare) are the ones that incorporate all-natural ingredients and avoid parabens and sulfates. The presence of the former and the absence of the latter promote healthier skin and moisturize without causing irritation.\nIf we\u2019re talking razors or clippers, then prioritize durable construction and general efficacy.\nSkin Type\nNot all of the best grooming products for men are created equal. This is especially true when it comes to which ones are best for specific skin types.\nIf you have acne or dry skin, for example, you\u2019ll want to prioritize products catered to addressing those specific conditions. There\u2019s a grooming product out there for every hair and skin type, so don\u2019t skimp on the research when choosing the right one for you.\nRoutine\nThere\u2019s a product out there (nay, hundreds of products) for every inch of every body, regardless of your unique needs. Honing in on the right lineup for you depends on your specific grooming routine and which areas of your body you want to prioritize.\nTo help you navigate your seemingly endless options, start by researching products that align with your particular grooming routine and target areas. Or just follow my lead and call it a day.\nbolinwebbworld / Instagram \nHow We Chose\nAs a fashion and grooming writer at FashionBeans, I compare, test, and research the products that make a gentleman a gentleman. If it can be worn, carried, or used in a way that elevates your look and feel, I\u2019m into it.\nFor this review, I pored over trusted sources, customer reviews, ingredient specifications, and my own experience to understand what makes the best men\u2019s grooming products. After comparing dozens of the top men\u2019s grooming products, the resulting 25 are what I\u2019m calling the best of the best. Some of my key considerations include:\nPurpose: \u201cBest men\u2019s grooming products\u201d is a very broad stroke. That in mind, I made every effort to prioritize versatile products with universal functionality in terms of skin type, hair type, and overall customer satisfaction.\nShampoos, conditioners, and face washes are cornerstones of every men\u2019s grooming routine. But sleeper products like mouthwashes and acne products also deserve their time in the sun.\nCustomer Reviews: I reviewed multiple product reviews in search of both positive and negative throughlines before citing various perspectives throughout this list.\nPrice: Yes, you need your various grooming products to work\u2014but you also need the expense to be commensurate with your current financial situation. We\u2019re all spoiled for choice, so there\u2019s no need to overpay for anything. I kept that consideration top of mind when choosing all 25 of these products.\nWhy Trust Us?\nKelly, a seasoned writer at FashionBeans, has a wealth of experience in the men\u2019s grooming and fashion arena, making him the go-to expert for recommendations on the best men\u2019s grooming products.\nWith a keen eye for detail and a passion for the latest trends, he meticulously tests and researches every product, ensuring that they meet the high standards of style, effectiveness, and innovation that FashionBeans readers expect.\nHe\u2019s also written prolifically on the topic, covering the ideal men\u2019s hair care routine, the best moisturizing body washes, electric razors, shaving kits, long-lasting colognes\u2026 we could go on.\nHis approach combines firsthand testing with insights from industry professionals, ensuring that each recommendation is grounded in real-world experience and expert analysis. Trust Kelly to guide you through the intricate world of men\u2019s grooming, where he not only highlights the best products but also educates you on their proper use and benefits.\nFinal Verdict \nIf I allowed it to, this list of the best men\u2019s grooming products could\u2019ve gone on forever. If we\u2019re talking razors, it\u2019s all about a powerful motor and a close, comfortable shave. If we\u2019re talking hair or face products, quality, lightly scented, natural ingredients need to be part of the conversation.\nBut since a great shampoo and conditioner are cornerstones of any men\u2019s routine, my top respective picks are Brickell\u2019s Daily Strengthening Shampoo and Bevel\u2019s gentle, sulfate-free conditioner.\nFAQ\nAlways use a moisturizer with SPF. Don\u2019t skimp on the conditioner. And don\u2019t forget the lotion. Or the acne spot treatments. It goes on and on. But at the end of the day, good grooming for men is whatever makes the most sense for your unique situation and personal preferences."

    "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, WWD may receive an affiliate commission. \nIt\u2019s rare for a product to come around and completely shift its cosmetic category \u2014 and millions of makeup routines. The viral E.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter did just that, as it\u2019s not quite a foundation, nor a liquid highlighter, but a Goldilocks multi-purpose product that functions as a complexion-smoother and radiance-enhancer all in one. For years its been the talk of the town on TikTok, with hundreds of millions of views and searches, so I Prime ordered it at the height of the hype to test out whether or not it was worth the buy. \nIn all honesty, I was initially confused on the intended use of the product, so here\u2019s some clarity off the bat: E.l.f. Cosmetics defines the Halo Glow Liquid Filter as a \u201cmakeup-skincare hybrid\u201d and a \u201ccomplexion glow booster for a glowing, soft-focus look.\u201d It\u2019s designed to provide a \u201csocial filter effect IRL\u201d as an all-over face product powered by hydrating hyaluronic acid and squalane. While it appears and applies like a foundation, it delivers much lighter coverage that\u2019s blended with finely-milled shimmer, and can be worn four ways: all over the face on its own, on areas you\u2019d place highlighter, as a base under makeup, or mixed with other complexion products. \nDewy, glowy, \u201cclean girl\u201d face products are hardly new to the market, however the Halo Glow Liquid Filter offers something that typical sheer, skin care-infused makeup hasn\u2019t before: buildable coverage. It marks a middle ground between a skin-like finish and a transformative effect, resulting in a complexion that looks visibly plump, healthy, and blurred. It\u2019s lightweight enough to compete with the best tinted moisturizers or skin tints, while offering comparatively better blendability and comfort than its drugstore foundation counterparts. \nE.l.f.\u2019s Halo Glow Liquid Filter has become a household name among beauty lovers, boasting over 5,000 five-star reviews on Amazon with shoppers raving over its easy application and multi-purpose function. \u201cI heard the hype but nothing would\u2019ve prepared me for how amazing this product is,\u201d wrote one tester. \u201cIt\u2019s sheer but has coverage, and leaves a beautiful glow without looking oily.\u201d Another said, \u201cWow \u2014 It took me way too long to try this. I am 35 years old with dry and sensitive skin, and this stuff makes my skin look so smooth and glowy (but not glittery!). It\u2019s a glorious alternative for the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter and is a must-have in your makeup routine.\u201d \nBelow, read our testing review of the viral E.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter \u2014 and take it for a spin yourself while it\u2019s marked down during Amazon\u2019s Big Spring Beauty Sale.\nSign up for WWD Shop\u2018s newsletter to get the scoop on the best in beauty and style with in-depth reviews of exciting new releases and buyer\u2019s guides to find the products you need to try ASAP.\nHow We Tested The E.l.f. Cosmetics Halo Glow Liquid Filter \nProduct tested: E.l.f. Cosmetics Halo Glow Liquid Filter\nTesting time period: One year\nNumber of testers: One WWD Shop editor with combination skin\nApplication method: I tested the E.l.f. Cosmetics Halo Glow Liquid Filter with both a buffing makeup brush and a beauty sponge. I applied it as a foundation base, mixed with other complexion products, such as foundation and BB cream, and on its own with concealer.\nKey ingredients: Hyaluronic acid, squalane, finely-milled powders\nShades: 12 shades available\nCoverage: Light to medium, buildable\nFinish: Dewy\nRetailer availability: Amazon, Ulta, E.l.f\nPros: \nLightweight\nHydrating\nBlends easily into the skin\nSmooths the complexion and infuses a healthy glow\nMess-free packaging\nCons: \nMay appear too shiny on oily skin types\nGlass bottle is on the heavy side (4.96 oz)\nTesting review: \u201cAs someone who doesn\u2019t like to wear heavy foundation but likes to even out my skin tone, I am so impressed with this product. It feels super lightweight and moisturizing, and, when used alone, looks very natural and allows for my freckles to shine through. The large doe foot applicator is great for clean and controlled coverage. The product blends like a dream and visibly smooths skin with a radiant finish.\u201d\nE.l.f. Cosmetics Halo Glow Liquid Filter \nAmazon Top-Quality Store Badge on Google: 4.5/5 stars \nPrice upon publish date of this article: $11.90 \nE.l.f. Cosmetics Halo Glow Liquid Filter \u2014 Editor Testing Notes \nAs much as I enjoy the flawless finish of foundation, I can\u2019t always get behind wearing heavy layers of product on the daily. For years I\u2019ve DIY\u2019d my own complexion formulas for more lightweight, dewy coverage, whether by mixing moisturizers with foundation, adding glow-boosting drops to BB creams, or forgoing an all-over face product for touches of concealer. When I got word that the E.l.f. Cosmetics Halo Glow Liquid Filter functioned as hydrating complexion enhancer that evened out the skin tone with light coverage, I was eager to try it out for myself (via speedy Amazon Prime shipping). \nFor context, I have combination skin that requires a lot of hydration and tends to produce oil in my T-zone. It often reacts immediately when I introduce new product to my routine, but I\u2019m happy to report that the Halo Glow Liquid Filter did not leave me with pesky breakouts or texture upon initial application. Another positive first impression worth noting? The packaging. The weighty glass bottle feels surprisingly luxe for such an affordable price point, and it looks aesthetically pleasing among my arsenal of prestige foundations. It applies in controlled amounts with a chubby doe foot applicator that I find to be ingenious, considering that pour or pump foundations can leave you cleaning up built-up gunk and spills \u2014 not so glamourous. \nThe Halo Glow Liquid Filter melts into the skin so effortlessly with my face brush of choice, which just so happens to be the E.l.f. Buffing Foundation Brush. I also tested the product with a beauty sponge, which blends it evenly all the same, but results in much lighter coverage. The product feels instantly hydrating and soothing upon application, where you can visibly see the healthy, lit-from-within glow that comes from the inclusion of hyaluronic acid and squalane. While I was skeptical it would leave me with a shimmery, unflattering finish once I stepped in sunlight, that\u2019s not the case here, as the reflective bits in the formula are so fine that you can\u2019t detect them with the naked eye. I also noticed the finely milled powders at work \u2014 my skin appeared super smooth and blurred, and was pleased to see my natural skin and freckles shine through.\nNeedless to say, the E.l.f. Cosmetics Halo Glow Liquid Filter has become a mainstay in my makeup bag, as I routinely wear it on days I want coverage without feeling congested, and I love to mix it with foundations for a more dewy finish. Though E.l.f. claims it\u2019s suitable for the range of skin types, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend it for super oily skin \u2014 and it\u2019s certainly no replacement for a skin care routine. It\u2019s a comfortable no-makeup-makeup complexion product, with buildable coverage that lets your skin breathe, all while nourishing it with healthy hydration. \nShop More Editor-Tested E.l.f. Cosmetics Products \nE.l.f. Cosmetics Power Grip Primer \nAmazon\u2019s Choice\nAmazon Top-Quality Store Badge on Google: 4.5/5 stars \nEditor testing and review notes: \u201cFor only $10, this primer delivers as much makeup-gripping power as some of the top prestige options on the market. The tacky texture secures your makeup in place no matter the weather, and prevents your foundation, eye makeup, and bronzer from budging even if you\u2019re an eye-rubber or lean on your hand frequently. Best of all, it doesn\u2019t feel overly sticky or suffocating on the skin.\u201d\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $9.27 \nE.l.f. Cosmetics 16HR Camo Concealer \nAmazon Top-Quality Store Badge on Google: 4.5/5 stars \nEditor testing and review notes: \u201cAs a concealer lover, I have tried the gamut of drugstore and prestige options on the market, and this one from E.l.f is a serious standout. I have several shades for different purposes, from concealing blemishes, brightening my dark circles, and even contouring my cheekbones, and it never steers me wrong. It\u2019s rare when I find a formula that doesn\u2019t crease under my eyes, and I love reaching for this longwear product when I know I won\u2019t have time for touch-ups.\u201d\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $7 \nE.l.f. Cosmetics Flawless Satin Foundation \nAmazon Top-Quality Store Badge on Google: 4.5/5 stars \nEditor testing and review notes: \u201cI was floored by the E.l.f. Flawless Satin Foundation, considering its unbeatable price point. It pumps out to a thicker consistency, which feels creamy, hydrating, and cooling as you blend it out. I applied the foundation with clean fingertips as well as a buffing brush during testing, and both techniques resulted in a very natural, non-streaky, and comfortable semi-matte finish. This foundation provides nice medium coverage that\u2019s buildable and doesn\u2019t leave the skin dry and cakey throughout the day. This formula would likely suit the range of skin types, though I\u2019d recommend that those with combination and oily skin powder their T zone or use a mattifying primer to ward off unwanted shine. Capping at just $6, this is a hidden gem at the drugstore and worth the try \u2014 regardless if you\u2019re on a tight beauty budget.\u201d\nPrice upon publish date of this article: $6 \nE.l.f. Cosmetics Lash it Loud Waterproof Mascara \nAmazon\u2019s Choice\nAmazon Top-Quality Store Badge on Google: 4.5/5 stars \nEditor testing and review notes: \u201cThe E.l.f Cosmetics Lash It Loud Waterproof Mascara\u2019s silicone brush did an impressive job at combing each lash \u2014 and notably fits nicely in the small corners of the eye \u2014 to create defined volume. Despite its wet formula, it is successful in building thickness while extending the length of the lash line for a dramatic transformation that ticks every box. Lash It Loud is particularly stellar at extending the length of the fine bottom lashes with a single swipe. As for its waterproof power, this mascara was tested in the shower, at the beach, and throughout several hot sunny days, and it successfully resisted flaking, smudging, running, or budging. When you\u2019re ready to wash it away, a makeup removing cloth or simple eye-safe face wash will do the trick, without any harsh rubbing or risk of losing any lashes in the process.\u201d \nPrice upon publish date of this article: $6 \nBefore you go, check out more editor-loved Amazon beauty products: \nWhy Trust WWD? \nSince 1910, WWD \u2014 often referred to as \u201cthe fashion bible\u201d \u2014 has been the leading industry voice of authority for senior executives in the global women\u2019s and men\u2019s fashion, retail and beauty communities, while also informing the consumer media that cover the market.

    "text": "The circulation of old beauty vlogs on TikTok has led to collective mourning of simpler times... but were they really that good?\nArguably the big bang of the influencing age, early beauty gurus on YouTube were defined by their commitment to extremely long-form content, DIY beauty tips and excessive morning vlogs. Though the algorithmic overlords have since seen them sacrificed to a landslide of short-form content, over the past few months clips from this era have begun recirculating TikTok, with old viewers collectively mourning a long-gone era of internet history. \u201cIt\u2019s like a warm hug from the past,\u201d says 21-year-old Alex, who\u2019s racked up thousands of followers from reposting videos on the account \u2018forevernostalgia\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to watch videos created before social media was saturated with product placements.\u201d\nWhen revisited within the context of TikTok\u2019s short and speedy content wheel, these clips illuminate the drastic evolution of digital beauty influencing in the past decade. People commenting on Alex\u2019s videos celebrate, and often share surprise in, the level of simplicity they didn\u2019t notice at the time. While large portions of today\u2019s beauty content recommends new cosmetic procedures or expensive anti-ageing products, early YouTube videos offered simple, accessible guidance. Michelle Phan catapulted to internet fame with a slew of DIY facemask videos with pore-clogging ingredients that would make the TikTok aestheticians of 2024 shudder, while Blair Fowler (under the apt 00s screenname Juicystar07) regularly uploaded 15-minute, webcam-quality hair tutorials while monologuing about her life.\nThis innocence can often seem absent from beauty content today. In these early videos, creators were publicising the girls\u2019 bedroom culture that had previously been private, and viewers were enticed by the concept of seeing somebody like them offer lived advice in real time. \u201cThe typically domestic, bedroom settings in which these tutorials were filmed and viewed, as well as the use of filming techniques like close-ups, encouraged strong bonds of intimacy to develop between viewers and creators,\u201d explains Rachel Berryman, digital influencer researcher at Curtin University, Perth. \u201cWhat was previously a solitary experience \u2013 applying make-up in your bedroom \u2013 came to feel more like a social activity.\u201d\nThis emphasis on the social aspect of beauty content, prior to the introduction of brand partnerships, is key to their newfound cult following. \u201cI think beauty content then wasn\u2019t so intrinsically tied to capitalism and consumerism, which it transparently is now,\u201d says 20-year-old Grace, an avid watcher of early 2010s beauty YouTube. \u201cThe discourse around beauty trends, feminism and the damaging effects of social media is vast now, and although it\u2019s important and something I engage with regularly, watching Zoella videos at 12 was just about putting up fairy lights and doing the five-minute makeup challenge.\u201d 25-year-old Jonny, who was also a fan of the beauty community at the time, concurs. \u201cIt harkens back to a time before content was so focused on views. Videos felt more authentic before the ties between make-up content creation and advertising became clear,\u201d they say.\nSo what changed? According to Brooke Erin Duffy, associate professor in the Department of Communication at Cornell University, once advertisers realised they could capitalise on the communities surrounding these creators, the game was forever changed. \u201cThe seeming professionalisation of this sector owes much to the astonishing growth of influencer marketing. Beauty brands covet a more \u2018authentic\u2019 sales force, and people increasingly turn to online personalities for advice, recommendations and lived expertise,\u201d she says.\nIt means many creators now want to target older audiences with disposable incomes, rather than create relatable content for young girls. \u201cIn the 2010s it seemed most videos were aimed towards the tween demographic whereas today it seems there\u2019s a growing gap in content for this age range,\u201d Alex says. Yet the result isn\u2019t that young people are discouraged from consuming beauty content, but that they\u2019re following advice not intended for them. Recent months have seen reports of pre-teens coveting expensive skincare products in place of the drugstore lip balms that dominated the early YouTube era. \u201cZoella would use a three pound Collection concealer. We could go to the high street and buy those Rimmel lipsticks and recreate her looks,\u201d says Grace. \u201cNow, you need a Dyson Airwrap for \u00a3500, the Clinique Black Honey at \u00a325 and a Drunk Elephant moisturiser for \u00a360, and those products will be tossed out tomorrow for the next trend.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy then, to be sucked back into the utopian world these older videos seemed to create. Yet perhaps it\u2019s a mistake to adopt such a rose-tinted outlook. The recirculated content also acts as a reminder of how whitewashed the beauty industry was only a few years ago, with the majority of creators fitting into a very specific mould. \u201cThe image of beauty that circulated at this time tended to reaffirm traditional representations of beauty and femininity \u2013 young, white, thin and conventionally attractive,\u201d says Duffy. This was escalated by the introduction of brand partnerships. \u201cThere were exceptions, of course, but advertisers tended to partner with beauty vloggers who weren\u2019t all that different from those in the legacy media industries.\u201d\nSo perhaps the widespread nostalgia is misplaced, despite how desperate some may be for a return of crackle nail polish. Yet it does seem to point to a collective yearning for a more community-focused internet. While algorithms have worked to curate feeds that show us exactly what we want to see, these videos suggest it may be the very opposite that we truly desire. \u201cLooking back, the experience of YouTube in the early 2010s feels a lot more unified than the social media platforms we use today. There was a sense of a shared experience and community: the homepage promoted videos that other viewers were engaging with, not only those related to your personal viewing habits,\u201d Berryman points out. \u201cThe nostalgia we see on TikTok today may not be just for a particular style of content or group of creators, but rather for a missed sense of community.\u201d"

Promise.\nWhile everyone else brings their shorts and sandals out of retirement when the weather app strikes 70 degrees, I unload all of my cream blushes, colorful eyeshadows, and glowy skin tints. Because the thing I'm most excited about rn is testing out all the new summer 2024 makeup trends I've had in my Instagram saves for months. We're talking the usual suspects like bright hues and glossy skin\u2014but less-trends have also made their way onto my mood board, like grunge-y eye looks and matte lips.\nAnd don't just take my word for it: I consulted a makeup artist for her summer 2024 makeup trend predictions, too, and dug into every runway show from last fall to give you the inside scoop on what to look forward to this season. Keep scrolling for all of my picks, including some tips to get the look at home and our favorite products to stock your makeup bag with:\n1. Summer 2024 Makeup Trend: Colored Mascara\n\"I definitely think that is going to be the summer of colored mascara,\" says makeup artist Amrita Mehta. \"It\u2019s a quick, easy, and foolproof way to add an unexpected pop of color to any look.\" I actually copied this look last fall (~trendsetter~ status) and opted for a blue mascara; I loaded up the brush and added three coats of mascara for an opaque look, then dipped a Q-tip in micellar water to clean up any smudges.\nYves Saint Laurent Lash Clash Extreme Volume Mascara\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Voluminous Original Mascara\nNow 18% Off\n2. Summer 2024 Makeup Trend: Blue Eyeshadow Looks\nBlue eyeshadow is about to be everywhere this summer. You can try an all-over wash of sky blue with winged eyeliner for a '60s vibe, take the trend in a more Euphoria direction with hella glitter, or go for a '90s, icy-frost vibe (which Mehta is seriously anticipating). Celebs have also started incorporating different blue tones in their looks, like Ayo Edebiri\u2014above\u2014with this periwinkle inner corner. \nAmi Cole Lid Joy\nColourPop Pressed Powder Eyeshadow Makeup Palette in Blue Velvet\n3. Summer 2024 Makeup Trend: Wet Skin\nOne thing's for sure: Glowy skin will never go out of style, especially for summertime. But in 2024, things are getting glossy, wet, and even a lil sticky, honestly. Gleaming skin is a look all on its own, whether you've used a dewy foundation that delivers glass-like skin or have dabbed a shiny highlighter onto your cheekbones for a targeted effect. Powder is not encouraged\u2014embrace the grease, folks\u2014but if you want to tone it down a smidge, pat a finely milled setting powder with a puff to keep it exactly where you want it. \nArmani Beauty Luminous Silk Perfect Glow Flawless Oil-Free Foundation\nSaie Glowy Super Gel Lightweight Dewy Multipurpose Illuminator\n4. Summer 2024 Makeup Trend: Muted, Blurry Lips \nSpotted on runways like Jacquemus, Acne Studios, and Maison Margiela for spring/summer 2024: A muted, '90s-minded blurry lip in cool-toned berry shades and warm, terracota reds. The key here is to smudge your lip color on with your fingers instead of applying it straight from the tube. Also, opt for a matte formula with a powdery finish. It'll give you that lived-in look, as if your lipstick just naturally faded to that hue throughout the day.\nFreck Beauty Makeout Club Soft Blur Lipstick\nSimihaze Beauty Velvet Blur Matte Lipstick Balm\n5. Summer 2024 Makeup Trend: Doll Blush \nIf you peep the Anna Sui spring/summer 2024 show, you'll see that the blush trend is going nowhere. Actually, it's evolved for this summer into a doll-like moment\u2014not shocking the year after the Barbie movie. For inspo, look to celebs like Sabrina Carpenter and Zendaya, above\u2014a dusting of pink blush, concentrated on the apples of your cheeks, is about to be all the rage. Want it to last all night, though, especially in sweaty conditions? Layer your cream blush with a powder on top for extra coverage and to set it in place.\nR.e.m. Beauty Hypernova Satin Matte Blush\nRevlon Illuminance Gel Serum Blush\n6. Summer 2024 Makeup Trend: Matte Smokey Eyes \n\"Grunge-y makeup is going to have its moment,\" Mehta says. In fact, it already has on the runways with Luar, Louis Vuitton, and LaQuan Smith all following suit\u2014as well as Demi Lovato, pictured above. \"Effortless smudged and smokey looks, especially with tight-lined eyes, will bring the drama with minimal effort for summer,\" says Mehta.\nMakeup By Mario Master Mattes Eyeshadow Palette: The Neutrals\nLaura Mercier Caviar Stick Matte Eyeshadow\n7. Summer 2024 Makeup Trend: Holographic Makeup\nMultichrome is here, bb, specifically in holographic swipes across your eyes, cheeks, and lips. More is more in this case, so don't hesitate to go for the finish across multiple products, like a metallic lip gloss paired with OTT glitter eyeshadow in a pink-purple shade. And if you needed more convincing to douse yourself in glitter, Priscavera had models cover their chests in iridescent highlighter.

    "text": "We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we love. Promise.\nAs we\u2019ve seen nail trends come and go over the past few years, one thing has become clear: Everyone gets excited about a nail idea that feels fun and fresh. (Ahem, does anyone else remember the summer of glazed-doughnut nails?) And according to nail artist Aja Walton, we\u2019ve got a lot to look forward to when it comes to summer 2024 nail trends. \nThis year, expect the unexpected when it comes to nail art, designs, and shapes. We\u2019re predicting unique new shapes (see \u201cRussian almond\u201d below), kitschy designs, pastel tones, and mega nail art. Keep scrolling for all of our summer 2024 nail trend predictions, straight from Walton.\n1. Summer 2024 Nail Trend: Metallic Jelly Nails\nAccording to Walton, \u201cmetallic accents\u2014in shades of silver chrome, rose gold, and copper\u2014over jelly nudes\u201d will be one of the biggest new trends of summer 2024. And luckily, there are a ~handful~ of ways to get the look for yourself. \u201cThese clear and often multicolor-shifting shades give a beam-like shine in popular purples and blues,\u201d she says.\nTry sandwiching a chrome or metallic nail polish with a jelly polish to achieve that sheer look with lots of shimmer and shine. \u201cApply one coat of a translucent or jelly color, followed by one coat of chrome-effect polish or powder,\u201d says Walton. \u201cThen layer with another coat of the same jelly polish.\u201d You can also try this with magnetic polish if you want a more velvety or cat-eye vibe rather than shine. \nCirque Colors Morningtide Jelly Nail Polish\nCirque Colors Morningtide Jelly Nail Polish\n2. Summer 2024 Nail Trend: Clean, Fresh Cuticles\nSometimes the chicest nail look is one that makes your nails and skin look healthy AF. This summer, minimal nail designs and nude nail polishes will get a big upgrade when paired with moisturized, clean cuticles and hands. Grab yourself a manicure set to help groom your cuticles at home\u2014but leave cuticle cutting to the pros to avoid any nicks or cuts\u2014and make sure to load on cuticle oil daily and nail strengtheners in between polish. FWIW, I\u2019m legit obsessed with this nail strengthener rn:\nCND RESCUERXx Daily Keratin Treatment\nCND RESCUERXx Daily Keratin Treatment\n3. Summer 2024 Nail Trend: Russian Almond Shape\nPractical? No. Worth it? 100%. \u201cThe Russian almond nail shape is a variation of the classic almond shape but with a more pronounced, elongated, and tapered tip,\u201d says Walton. Think of it like a marriage of almond and stiletto nails. \u201cIts pointed yet slightly rounded edges are achieved by filing the sides of the nail into a pointed tip while maintaining a soft curve along the edges.\u201d\n4. Summer 2024 Nail Trend: Pastel Nail Colors\nTell the eye-popping brights to back off. \u201cThis summer, soft and delicate pastels will gain popularity with baby pink, mint green, and soft lemon leading the palette,\u201d says Walton. It\u2019s fresh and fun for summertime without the intensity of the brights and neons we\u2019re used to seeing in the warm months. I\u2019m personally loving the bright pistachio, minty shade above, like... \nEssie Nail Polish in Mint Candy Apple\nEssie Nail Polish in Mint Candy Apple\nNow 12% Off\n5. Summer 2024 Nail Trend: Dripped French Tips\nFrench tips will never go out of style, but every year, we find a brand-spanking-new spin on the classic to make it feel modern. 2024\u2019s take? These drippy French tips in a gold chrome by nail artist Gina Edwards for the Prabal Gurung spring/summer 2024 show. If you\u2019re DIYing, feel free to opt for a shimmery gold polish and create imperfect French tips (no need for any hacks here\u2014the sloppier, the better). \nBut if you want to also go for this ultra-shiny, 3D look by Edwards, head to the salon and ask your artist to create these swirly tips with soft gel, then go over them with gold chrome powder. \nOPI OPI Infinite Shine in Five Golden Flings\nOPI OPI Infinite Shine in Five Golden Flings\n6. Summer 2024 Nail Trend: Cherry Nail Designs \nKitschy nail art will reign supreme this summer, including these adorable cherry nails, says Walton. But feel free to tailor this to your ~vibes~ with fruits, lil cute insects, magic eight balls, or whatever your heart desires. If you\u2019re a real Van Gogh, you can casually paint these on your nails, but if not, no biggie\u2014just stick on a nail decal. \nBellecrey Cherry Nails Art Stickers\nBellecrey Cherry Nails Art Stickers\n7. Summer 2024 Nail Trend: Aqua Nail Colors\nThink beach. \u201cAlso gaining in popularity are ocean blues and greens like aqua, seafoam and cobalt blue, especially in a monochromatic fashion,\u201d says Walton. Which is why I\u2019ll be donning my nails in this stunning, vivid aqua shade from China Glaze (shop below), which feels so summery and festive. But if you\u2019re just looking to, ahem, dip your fingers in the trend, try it with some French tips. \nChina Glaze Nail Polish in Too Yacht To Handle\nChina Glaze Nail Polish in Too Yacht To Handle\n8. Summer 2024 Nail Trend: Puffy Nail Art \nWalton predicts the puffy, 3D nail art trend will only getting bigger this summer, such as the cute hearts above. Generally, though, your best bet is heading to a nail artist who can create these with soft gel, then cure them with the UV nail lamp so they don\u2019t budge. Heads-up: Make sure to bring lots of examples from IG to your nail artist. Plus, it\u2019s always good practice to let your artist know when you make the appointment that you want a more ~laborious~ nail design so they can plan ahead properly for timing.\nMeet the expert: \nAja Walton is a celebrity and editorial nail artist based in Brooklyn, NY.

    "text": "We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we love. Promise.\nIf you\u2019re on TikTok, you\u2019ve probably seen them on your FYP, wearing athleisure sets in chic neutrals while making the bed. Or preparing coffee for their boyfriends and a Bloom Nutrition drink for themselves. Maybe they\u2019re getting their nails done, showing you their skincare routine, or going to Pilates, narrating their day while twinkly music plays in the background: \u201cA day in my life as a stay-at-home girlfriend.\u201d\nSearch terms like \u201cstay-at-home girlfriend\u201d (37.3 million views), \u201clife as a stay-at-home girlfriend\u201d (37.8 million views), \u201cstay at home GF\u201d (36.2 million views), and \u201cSAHG\u201d (34 million views) are increasingly popular on TikTok. The trend has been featured in recent pieces in the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal, the latter of which attributed it to \u201ca Gen Z move away from mid-2000s \u2018girl boss\u2019 hustle culture, and toward aspirations of a softer life.\u201d Some of the SAHGs describe their lifestyle in similar, seemingly progressive language: \u201cPeople used to ask me, \u2018What\u2019s your dream job?\u2019 I never knew the answer. I realized it\u2019s because I don\u2019t dream of labor. I dream of living a soft, feminine life and being a hot housewife. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d says influencer Kendel Kay (@kendelkay) in a video with 1.6 million views from September 2023.\nBut as some of the comments on these TikToks vocally point out, the life of a SAHG is risky, to say the least. \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good until he breaks up with you,\u201d wrote one. Enter: the side of SAHG TikTok you don\u2019t see\u2014the post-breakup videos warning you of the financial and emotional risks that come with this lifestyle. They might not be as sparkly or aspirational (which might explain why they don\u2019t have as many views), but they\u2019re just as real and important. And if you\u2019re going to surrender financial independence to become a SAHG, you should go into it with clarity about what could happen if the relationship ends. \n\u201cIf you give a man the power to feed you, he also has the power to starve you.\u201d\nOne of the most popular SAHG breakup videos comes from beauty and lifestyle influencer Bella Greenlee (@zizzysizzle). \u201cComing as somebody who has been a stay-at-home girlfriend for three years, it\u2019s not the life you want,\u201d Greenlee says in the video. \u201cIf he is paying for your whole life and you don\u2019t have any income at all, there will start to be resentment. I\u2019m just glad that I was young, I didn\u2019t have any kids, I was not married, and I was able to start my life before I wasted more years just staying in the house.\u201d \nWith over 3.2 million views, Greenlee\u2019s video has been stitched time and time again, with some people agreeing with her, and others arguing that a man\u2019s role should be to provide financially. When I chat with Greenlee over Zoom, she stands behind what she said in her video, \u201cIf you give a man the power to feed you, he also has the power to starve you.\u201d \nGreenlee says that becoming a SAHG was \u201csomething that slowly happened.\u201d She and her ex started dating in the early days of COVID, when she was unemployed. As their relationship got more serious, she became financially dependent on him. To her followers, everything looked rosy. \u201cI would post \u2018my day in the life,\u2019 videos, so it would be cleaning or making breakfast,\u201d Greenlee says. \u201cEverybody was thinking I was living this really peaceful, happy life.\u201d But in reality, she says, \u201cI would clean the house more than I had to, just to keep myself entertained. I didn\u2019t really have a lot to do, so I was kind of going crazy.\u201d The fact that she was relying on her then-boyfriend financially meant that, as she says, \u201cI kind of felt like I had to walk on eggshells because I knew that he had the power to take away my whole life if he wanted to. I felt like I didn\u2019t have a voice in the relationship.\u201d\n\u201cI gave away everything I had.\u201d\nThe situation really sunk in when Greenlee discovered her ex was cheating. \u201cIt was really hard for me to be like, Oh, I\u2019m gonna leave like a regular woman would, because he was funding my whole life, so I couldn\u2019t just leave like that,\u201d she says. \u201cI really had to make a game plan for myself.\u201d \nAfter the breakup, Greenlee moved in with her dad and focused on making her own money. At first, she supplemented her influencer income with money she made babysitting. Now, she\u2019s a full-time content creator. She\u2019s also in a new relationship, and this time, she\u2019s determined to maintain her financial independence.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be very strict on not moving in with anybody until I\u2019m engaged or something, and I definitely have to have my own career. I make it known to whoever I\u2019m talking to that I\u2019m always going to make my own money,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m never going to 100 percent rely on that person.\u201d\n\u201cI am absolutely left with nothing.\u201d\nAri Luu (@yoohooits.ariluu) has also been documenting her experience of reinventing her life on TikTok. As she puts it on her podcast Delusional Daydreams, \u201cI have no car, I have no job, I have no money, because to be quite honest, for the past three and a half years, I\u2019ve been a stay-at-home girlfriend. I was put in this position to stay at home, be taken care of, and really be the support system for my partner. And by doing so, I gave away everything I had. And now I am absolutely left with nothing.\u201d\nWhen Luu first began dating her ex, she explored a variety of self-employment career paths, none of which ended up working out. Her then-partner was making enough to support them both, and he\u2019d just bought a condo. Luu moved in. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how it started,\u201d she tells me on Zoom. \u201cHe was really supportive throughout my whole journey, just like I was supportive in helping him advance in his career. The only difference was I wasn\u2019t making money.\u201d\nAt first, Luu felt okay with the situation. Her relationship was the healthiest one she\u2019d ever been in, and \u201cwe just felt like we were married from the get-go,\u201d she says. They combined finances, and Luu took on more of the household chores. But as time went on, her feelings changed. \u201cI love keeping a clean space, I love cooking, and I love doing the homely duties. But after a while of being the only person contributing [to the housework], it\u2019s like, Damn, if I was making money, I could just be doing this on my own and not have to take care of someone else,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you know, he was contributing financially. So then it\u2019s like, How can I speak on that? That internal conflict just got stressful.\u201d\n\u201cI want to feel like I'm doing something for myself.\u201d\nShe was also struggling with her self-worth, exploring content creation and other creative options but unable to find a full-time job in their small town. \u201cAs time went, on I started getting more uncomfortable because I wasn\u2019t contributing anything, and I want to be proud of my own life as well,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to feel like I\u2019m doing something for myself.\u201d\nThe stress peaked after Luu experienced two miscarriages. \u201cThat kind of kick-started the questioning: Who am I? What do I want? What truly makes me happy?\u201d she says. She spent two months alone in Mexico to try and find the answers, but when she returned to her boyfriend\u2019s condo, that feeling of being \u201cstuck\u201d seeped right back in. \u201cIt felt like we were just going back to the old ways, where he was supporting me and I was trying to find a job where there was no opportunity. I just couldn\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d she says. \nShe moved back to her hometown to live with her dad and stepmom, and her relationship ended shortly after. Now, she\u2019s working at a restaurant while creating videos and podcasts about her journey. \u201cI\u2019ve been humbled, and it kind of has pushed me into this train of thought where it\u2019s like, my external circumstances do not define who I am and what I\u2019m capable of,\u201d she says. \u201cI just have to keep reminding myself every day that just because I\u2019m at my parents\u2019 house, just because I\u2019m working at a restaurant as a hostess doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do big things in my life. Sometimes you need to crumble a weak foundation to build a stronger one that you\u2019re truly meant for.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the ultimate financial scams.\u201d\nFinancial expert Farnoosh Torabi, host of the So Money podcast and author of A Healthy State of Panic: Follow Your Fears to Build Wealth, Crush Your Career, and Win at Life, is, to put it lightly, not a fan of the stay-at-home girlfriend trend. \u201cI think it's one of the ultimate financial scams,\u201d she says, pointing out that while stay-at-home wives often have financial protections in the event of a divorce, like spousal support and equitable division of assets acquired during the marriage, stay-at-home girlfriends don\u2019t. \u201cI think if you believe in feminism, it also means that you have to care about your financial well-being,\u201d she says. \u201cMoney is power. Money is protection. When you don\u2019t have it, and your boyfriend has it, you don\u2019t have power. You don\u2019t have protection. What happens when you go from being a stay-at-home girlfriend to just a stay-at-home girl?\u201d \nTheoretically, Torabi says, couples could write a prenup-style contract before taking the stay-at-home girlfriend route, specifying what would happen in the event of a breakup and whether the girlfriend\u2019s partner would need to provide her with some sort of financial security. Contracts like this aren\u2019t unheard of, both with roommates and with long-term romantic couples who cohabitate but don\u2019t believe in marriage. But, Torabi says, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any boyfriends who are going to go for that.\u201d\n\u201cMoney becomes used as a tool to dominate you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s exactly because of the lack of power that stay-at-home girlfriends are at a high risk for financial abuse. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have any say in where the money goes in the household, and there\u2019s an emphasis on you not working, that is extremely dangerous,\u201d Torabi says. \u201cSuddenly, you may not have permission to go buy what you want, and you have to start asking for everything. Money becomes used as a tool to dominate you. I see this happening a lot. When one person isn\u2019t working, they have less power and less say. The person who manages all of it can take advantage of that position.\u201d\nPost-breakup, the most important thing a SAHG can do is start making their own money \u201ceven if it means moving back in with your family for a while to get your bearings or sleeping on a friend\u2019s couch,\u201d says Torabi. While she\u2019s sympathetic to women who are laid off or have trouble finding a job, she stresses that it\u2019s important to maintain some level of financial independence whether in or out of a relationship, even if it\u2019s by taking side gigs while searching for a full-time role. \n\u201cI know that not everyone\u2019s gonna agree with me, but I want all women to be financially independent,\u201d she says. \u201cWe live in America. Last I checked, it\u2019s a capitalist society. If you don\u2019t have money, you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d"

    "text": "I\u2019ve always loved and leaned most into the transitional months\u2014those that mark a significant shift in season and climate. As humans, we\u2019re naturally oriented toward change and novelty. We\u2019re attracted to what\u2019s untrodden and undiscovered\u2014those things in life that feel entirely new. This truth is an element of why it\u2019s so satisfying to live in sync with the seasons. Alongside feeling closer and connected to the natural world, we allow ourselves an organic refresh. That clean-slate feeling that forgives us of all we want to let go of\u2014and that which communicates an opportunity to start entirely anew.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: Isabelle, touch grass, please! But my April bucket list is grounded in that sense of starting over. While most people associate these sentiments with the start of the year, I find it hard to generate energy for my intentions when the weather would rather see me cozied up inside, mid-hour three of a long binge-reading sesh. \nSo whether you\u2019re looking for a similar new start or simply want to make the most of the month ahead, I have it all here for you. From spring cleaning everything in your life to all the many ways you can get yourself outside, this April bucket list will inspire you to explore new areas of life and chase after new dreams. After all, every day is a new beginning. \n30 Ideas to Add to Your April Bucket List\n1. Work out outside. With the weather warming up and more blue, sunny days in the forecast, try swapping out your indoor sweat sesh for a little time outdoors. Schedule hikes with friends, try your hand at tennis or pickleball, and plan for a few lake days if the weather allows. Vitamin D and endorphins? We love.\n2. Host a picnic. Is there anything better than setting down a blanket and soaking up an hour or two of the best spring pairing: fresh air and a sun-soaked meal? Steal these picnic recipes for inspiration.\n3. Read one of the best new spring books. PSA: reading is a year-round activity. If you\u2019re feeling stumped by your TBR or craving a new title, consult our list of the best new spring releases. \n4. Buy yourself flowers. You deserve a little bouquet of beauty in your kitchen or on your desk every week. Hit up Trader Joe\u2019s for the best budget blooms that are still undeniably gorgeous.\n5. Clean out your closet. It\u2019s time. If you still need help in crossing this task off your spring cleaning to-do list, we have all the Marie Kondo-approved answers, right here.\n6. Revisit your vision board. No, your January 1st vision board is not a one-and-done process. It\u2019s something you come back to throughout the year to check in on your progress and growth. For signs that your vision board is working, we tallied all the green flags you should pay attention to.\n7. Play around with 2024 fashion trends. These are the biggest buys in fashion right now. And in case you need more options, we also shared their totally enviable dupes.\n8. Switch up your breakfast routine. If you\u2019re still on the cereal and milk train, take heart: the options are endless for an inspiring and colorful AM meal. Camille\u2019s grain-free overnight oatmeal is my current fave, but I also consider this green shakshuka a hyperfixation weekend brunch delight.\n9. Organize your photos. Set aside a couple of hours on a Sunday and you won\u2019t be sorry. If you have thousands of screenshots and duplicates in your albums, this is the guidance you need. \n10. Make your own yogurt. If it sounds complicated, trust: homemade yogurt is way easier than it seems. Plus, the benefits are endless (it\u2019s healthier, cuts down on packaging waste, etc.). Camille swears by this yogurt recipe that healed her gut.\n11. Pick up a guided journal. If you\u2019re just starting your journaling journey, there are plenty of guided options to select from. The primary benefit (besides the majority of them being extremely aesthetic!) is that they come with pre-written prompts, helping guide your thoughts and lead you to a deeper understanding of yourself.\n12. Spring clean your skincare. We swear by these expert tips to help transition your skin to the warmer weather.\n13. Step up your al fresco game. \u2018Tis the season for enjoying all our meals outdoors. Try Camille\u2019s spicy tuna tostadas (inspired by one of her favorite restaurants in Mexico City), avocado caprese, or a hot honey salmon that takes literally 10 minutes. \n14. Refresh your space. Spring cleaning is one thing, but breathing new life into every room of your home is exactly what you\u2019ll need to feel inspired and energized. These design tips may be simple, but they\u2019re absolutely game-changing.\n15. Shop the best vases for your spring blooms. Whether you\u2019re getting your fresh cuts from the backyard, flower market, or your local Trader Joe\u2019s, you\u2019ll need the perfect vessel to house them in. We named the best online sources for vases that spark joy.\n16. Make your home smell like spring. It\u2019s time to ditch the warm and spicy scents\u2014this season is all about fresh and clean fragrances. Our design editor names her favorite spring scents.\n17. Listen to the rain. April showers, May flowers, etc. It\u2019s an inevitable weather phenomenon of the month, but instead of lamenting the gray skies, try enjoying a little cozy moment of curling up and being present for the beauty of the rain.\n18. Visit the farmer\u2019s market. Because there\u2019s nothing better than romanticizing your weekly grocery shop. Explore all the best fresh veg and get inspired to cook up some spring meals.\n19. Try a new tea blend. While the weather might be warming, there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity to enjoy your favorite teas. I love peppermint, lavender, chamomile, or rose. And if you\u2019re looking for a serious stress-relieving cuppa, we rounded up the best right here.\n20. Pick up a new poetry collection. While I\u2019m one for fiction, I also love getting lost in a particularly resonant collection of poetry. Instructions for Traveling West is my current favorite, but I also love anything Mary Oliver or Cleo Wade.\n21. Bake something lemony. Is there a more quintessentially spring flavor? These gluten-free lemon bars are a favorite and our no-bake lemon cardamom bars couldn\u2019t be easier\u2014or more delicious. For all the lemon sweets and treats, our roundup has you covered.\n22. Plan your summer vacation. Get your warm-weather getaway situated. I just stayed at The Inn at Newport Ranch in California and was blown away by the property\u2019s natural beauty. Or, if you\u2019re looking for a quick trip from Chicago, nothing beats Destination Kohler. But if small towns are more your vibe, we have all the recommendations you need right here.\n23. Detoxify your cleaning routine. If you\u2019re looking to make the switch from bleach, look no further. We\u2019re sharing all of the best non-toxic cleaning products. Bonus: They smell amazing.\n24. Make a spring pasta recipe. Alongside spring salads and soups, pasta is a great way to make the most of the season\u2019s vibrant harvest. Can\u2019t make it to Italy this month? These spring pasta recipes are the next best thing.\n25. Pick up a new spring hobby. In need of an activity or new passion to take your mind away from work and other life stressors? Spring hobbies are just the thing. From gardening to hiking to foraging (and everything in between), this list has you covered.\n26. Go to a baseball game. It\u2019s like football in the fall\u2014there\u2019s something so satisfying about enjoying a warm weekend afternoon cheering on your team in the stands. Whether you shell out for a pro game or support your kiddos\u2019 t-ball team, there\u2019s endless fun to be had. \n27. Make a spring drink. Kombucha cocktails, a Lillet spritz, or Camille\u2019s favorite: the Salty Dog\u2014you have endless options to sip on.\n28. Leave notes of kindness in unexpected places. I love writing sweet little notes and affirmations and leaving them on car windshields, in mailboxes, or in my local coffee shop\u2019s tip jar. Some ideas: Your kindness doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. You bring purpose, presence, and passion to the world. You have a beautiful and profound impact on the people in your life.\n29. Reach out to loved ones you\u2019ve been meaning to call. On my list: my sisters, my college besties, my aunts and uncles. Brainstorm a few people you\u2019ve wanted to connect with and make the call. You have no idea how much it will mean.\n30. Try a cold plunge. It might not be summer yet, but you\u2019re still welcome to embrace all the benefits of a cold plunge. And honestly? This is the best time to make it happen. Find a body of water near you, bring layers to bundle up in afterward, and brave the chill. Bring friends\u2014cold plunging all the more fun with good company."

    "text": "We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we love. Promise.\nFor the first time in my beauty editor career, I'm packing up my face gems, glitter eyeshadows, and shimmery highlighters to head to the desert for Coachella. Don't get me wrong, I've done the festival makeup thing before\u2014but 'Chella is a whole other ball game, babes. It's been practically a full-time job gearing up for festival season (those 'fits don't plan themselves!) but the most exciting part has been scrolling through Instagram in search of festival makeup looks to copy. \nOf course, festival makeup can be as out-there and wild as you want it. Whether your vibe is sticking on a few face gems, dusting glitter all over your bod, swiping bright eyeshadow onto your lids, or simply letting the sweat of the day be your highlighter, anything goes! But if you, like me, are looking for inspo, you've come to the right place, as I've been compiling Coachella makeup looks for the last three months. Keep scrolling for all of my picks, plus products to try and a lil how-to. \nYour festival makeup starter pack:\nGemstone Tweezers\nHalf Magic Adornment Tweezers\nGems\nXO, Fetti Purple + Red Heart and Star Eye Face Gems\nHighlighter\nKimchi Chic Glam Tears Liquid Highlighter\nMini Setting Spray\nONE/SIZE by Patrick Starrr Mini On 'Til Dawn Mattifying Waterproof Setting Spray\n1. Festival Makeup Idea: Cobalt Blue Eyeshadow\nIs there any better occasion to coat your eyes in the richest blue eyeshadow imaginable? I don't think so. This look features two shades of blue for some dimension, but if you wanna make things easy af, just swipe a blue cream eyeshadow all over your lids and into your brow bone. And to get these soft lines, grab a clean blending brush and buff out the edges of your shadow. \nHaus Labs Hy-Power Eye, Cheek & Lip Pigment Paint\nHaus Labs Hy-Power Eye, Cheek & Lip Pigment Paint\n2. Festival Makeup Idea: Glitter Eyelashes\nWanna take a cue from runways? Models wore glittery false eyelashes at the Luar Fall/Winter 2024 show (yup, the one Beyonce was at!). And ever since I saw this look backstage, I knew it would be a hit for festival season. If you want to follow the reference to a T, grab a pair of glittery false lashes and cut them to fit only your outer corners. But if you're down to use this as inspo, feel free to stick a whole strip of tinsel lashes on, then dab some extra glitter on the inner corners of your eyes to bring the look together.\nMiss Kiss Glitter Eyelashes\nMiss Kiss Glitter Eyelashes\n3. Festival Makeup Idea: Doll Makeup Look\nI'll be damned if I don't pull out a Chappell Roan makeup look while I'm dancing to Femininomenon!! With this look, more is more, bb\u2014don't be afraid to layer on your bright cream blush with bright eyeshadow and red lipstick. If you know anything about Chappell's go-to look, you'll know it usually involves an ultra-white, full-coverage foundation. But (!) in the effort to feel your most comfortable waltzing around festival grounds all day, you can def just opt for a skin tint and load up on setting powder to keep your skin matte throughout the day without the heft.\nMaybelline New York Super Stay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick\nMaybelline New York Super Stay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick\nPsst: Guarantee this won't slide off, even while you're sipping tequila sodas and munching on street tacos.\n4. Festival Makeup Idea: Colored Mascara\nSometimes the simplest looks have the most impact. Case in point: This clumpy, colorful mascara, paired with dewy skin and brushed-up brows. Choose any color you like (I, personally, will be complementing my mermaidcore swimsuit with a purple mascara), so long as it can be built up in opacity for a bold look against your skin tone. For a finishing touch, grab a coordinating eyeliner pencil and line your lips with it \u00e0 la the look above.\nColourPop BFF Volumizing Mascara\nColourPop BFF Volumizing Mascara\n5. Festival Makeup Idea: Metallic Lips\nOne of the biggest summer makeup trends will be metallic lips, especially in this ombr\u00e9 style (ahem, this look was literally featured on the Palomo runway last fall). But it's basically a dream festival combo, too, since it uses bright colors and shimmer most people reserve for their eyes and cheeks. If you're not into reapplying (who is?), choose a metallic liquid lipstick, which will stay on through belting On My Mama and chugging overpriced water. \nUnicorn Snot Liquid Metal Lip Paint\nUnicorn Snot Liquid Metal Lip Paint\n6. Festival Makeup Idea: Icy Eyes\nY2K at a festival? ~Groundbreaking~. But if you want a festival makeup look to pair with your jorts and rhinestone belt, then frosty eyeshadow is the way to go. Brush a shimmery light-gray or icy-blue eyeshadow all over your lids and into the brow bone. To bring it all together, dust an icy-white highlighter on your cheekbones too.\nRevlon Colorstay Creme Eyeshadow\nRevlon Colorstay Creme Eyeshadow\n7. Festival Makeup Idea: Crystal Winged Eyeliner\nWhat's a festival makeup look without gemstones? It's the simplest way to incorporate some glitz in your look and only takes a few steps, tbh. If you wanna go all out, line your eyes with black liquid eyeliner, then follow that line with gems. You can even go for a full crystal lid, like the look above, if you're into it. But if you're feeling a little less creative, try opting for a set of face gems that are already paired together. Literally just peel off the backing, stick to your skin, and go.\nBakeup Beauty Playbox 456pcs Self Adhesive Eye Face and Body Gems\nBakeup Beauty Playbox 456pcs Self Adhesive Eye Face and Body Gems\n8. Festival Makeup Idea: Watercolor Eyes\nCan't choose a color? No prob, just put 'em all on your eyes. This look is shockingly easy\u2014you can legit just swipe each shade on your eyelids with your fingers\u2014but looks so intricate and special all together. Just make sure to blend on a layer of eyeshadow primer all over your lids beforehand for the most vivid color payoff.\nNYX Ultimate Shadow Palette Brights\nNYX Ultimate Shadow Palette Brights\nThe most important festival beauty tip? Load up on sunscreen\nKosas DreamBeam Silicone-Free Mineral Sunscreen SPF 40\nLive Tinted Hueguard Invisible Sunscreen Stick SPF 50\nDune Suncare The Bod Guard Gel Body Sunscreen\n9. Festival Makeup Idea: Glitter Eyebrow\nPersonally, I'll be dousing my entire body in glitter at Coachella. But if you want to keep things a bit more ~sensible~ (read: less messy), go for a glitter eyebrow moment. Just coat your brows in eyelash glue, let it get tacky for 30-ish seconds, then dab loose face glitter on your eyebrows. Or you can just brush on a glitter gel\u2014way less involved with a similar shiny payoff. \nLemonhead LA Spacepaste\nLemonhead LA Spacepaste\n10. Festival Makeup Idea: Disco Eyes and Cheeks\nThere's no other place on earth where you can carve out your cheekbones with a bright-pink, shimmery duochrome highlighter and call it minimalist\u2014so make the most of it. Combine your duochrome eyeshadows and highlighters into one look, then top it off with glittery lip gloss and a swipe of colored mascara. It's the festival way! \nThe Lip Bar Color Shift Duo Chrome Liquid Eyeshadow\nThe Lip Bar Color Shift Duo Chrome Liquid Eyeshadow\n11. Festival Makeup Idea: Graphic Eyeliner\nNot into color and shimmer? All good, bb, because festival szn is also about the abstract, like this graphic eyeliner look. Play around with lines and shapes, whether you go for this double-winged situation or you add spikes, extra lines, dots, swirls\u2014the options are endless here. But the key is choosing a waterproof, smudge-proof eyeliner that won't budge throughout the day (I am pro liquid liner for this, as you can create much sharper lines, but work with whatever is easiest for you). To seriously keep that liner in place, set it with a black eyeshadow, too. \nUrban Decay Perversion Waterproof Fine-Point Eye Pen\nUrban Decay Perversion Waterproof Fine-Point Eye Pen\n12. Festival Makeup Idea: Rhinestone Mask\nMake the whole place shimmer with a face covered in rhinestones like Emira D'Spain. This look will require a whole lotta face gems and some precision; map it out with a white eyeliner pencil before sticking your gems down to make sure your design is cohesive. Tie it all together with matte skin and long af eyelashes to really make the gems stand out.\nHalf Magic Iridescent Sparkle Self-Adhesive Face Gems\nHalf Magic Iridescent Sparkle Self-Adhesive Face Gems\nWhy trust Cosmopolitan? \nBeth Gillette is the beauty editor at Cosmopolitan with nearly six years of experience researching, writing, and editing makeup stories that range from lip stains to 2024 makeup trends.

Yet, some trends are universally frowned upon, transcending generational divides. \nRedditor Imaginary_Eye3804 ignited a thought-provoking conversation on the widely followed r/AskReddit forum. Participants shared their perspectives on current trends they find embarrassing and hope will disappear soon.\nRead more\n#1 Gender reveals. Complete and utter b******t.\nImage source: iamlesterq, Alex Hussein\n#2 The whole concept of \u201cinfluencers\u201d on social media. Pics and videos of their spotless huge houses, adorable well-behaved kids, cute pets. As if they don\u2019t wear Crocs and a messy bun to scoop dog poo off their perfectly manicured lawns.\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to bunch my hair into a bun, put on my \u201cdirty work\u201d shoes, and scoop the dog s**t out of my mud pit of a back yard. I\u2019m not going to make a video of it, but I guarantee it would be far more entertaining (and contain a lot more profanity) than any influencer video.\nImage source: TheNatureOfTheGame\n#3 Tween shopping hauls at Sephora for anti-aging skincare. Fad travel drinking cups (like Stanley) that cost more than a tank of gas.\nImage source: ILikeYourHotdog, muriloaugusto31\n#4 People who film others\u2019 misfortunes in order to gain clout. There\u2019s a dude on YT who films/posts every waking second of his Father with Alzheimer\u2019s; really really personal s**t, embarrassing s**t, and it\u2019s all for clout. Not to mention the elderly man is _incapable of consenting_ . Like, wtf. Cringe.\nAlso, those guys who film themselves buying lunch for their poorly paid, overworked migrant laborers and then act like saints because of it. It\u2019s for clout, not because they are angelic people.\nChasing clout in general, is IMO gross and desperate. Just like, be a good person if you really want to do good. And don\u2019t rush to film it, this gives away your true intentions.\nImage source: MrMojoRisin2288\n#5 TikTok disorder fakers. I have autism.

I just think that\u2019s so gross. Why do you need to video yourself crying? And from 3 different angles. I just don\u2019t understand it.

Some king of England had an a**l fistula and all the lords and ladies suddenly had one. Today\u2019s modern version of this is the spectrum and neurodivergence. Don\u2019t like how something feels yucky on your hands, on the spectrum! Do you get confused or distracted sometimes on the spectrum! Do you not always enjoy everyone\u2019s company all the time? It\u2019s neurodivergence for SURE!!! Now everybody can pretend to be special and self diagnose, or wise and tell everyone else what condition they have.

No contact is allowed, and so the kids usually don\u2019t budge and keep pushing for a reaction. It\u2019s gotten to the point now that if there\u2019s a highschool near your grocery store be prepared to ignore a bunch of tiktok dancers and pranksters as you shop because confrontation plays directly into their game anyway.\nImage source: Bulky-Rush-1392"

    "text": "French women are forever at the center of the fashion and beauty world, whether you're looking to embrace their effortlessly chic style or want to hit a French pharmacy to stock up on skincare.\nWhile there's no denying the French have influenced many trends, there is still a strong difference in how makeup is used there compared to in the U.S. \u2013 something that content creator Trisha Estopinan noticed after moving to Paris.\nThe 32-year-old, from Orlando, Florida, took to Instagram to share the main changes she'd made since moving to the French capital, demonstrating by having half her face U.S.-style and the other half in her updated routine.\nIn the viral Instagram post, which has gained over 219,000 views, Estopinan shares a simple three-step base routine, skipping out popular steps like contour, blush and bronzer as she embraces a more natural look.\nIn the viral video, Trisha Estopinan shared the surprising changes she's made to her make-up routine since moving to Paris. She's adopted a more natural look. mamadoeseurope/Instagram \nSpeaking to Newsweek, Estopinan, who first moved to Paris in 2020 for two years, and chose to return in January of 2023, shared: \"I used to wear a lot more makeup when I first moved here and most of the local women had a more natural 'less is more' look, so I've toned down my makeup and have been enjoying it!\"\nShe began by applying a skin tint as her base with a light coverage and slight shine, where in the U.S. she'd reach for a fuller coverage foundation.\nThe next step was to use a concealer to brighten under the eyes and help hide any dark circles, before finishing the skin with glow drops to create a dewy complexion.\nTo finish, she adds a mascara to lengthen the lashes and a lip oil for a hydrating flush of color, revealing the most striking difference between the two: a lack of eye makeup.\nA common theme to the products she picked up for the French-inspired look was the inclusion of skincare elements, with ingredients like vitamin C, caffeine and aloe vera present.\nSpeaking on the differences in the video, she said: \"I still think both look good, but my skin now feels like it can breathe. I used to wear a lot more foundation and bronzer in the U.S. And I just stopped doing that here.\"\nBeyond beauty, Estopinan also gave insight to the differences between the two countries when it comes to clothing, telling Newsweek how she thinks: \"French fashion sticks with more classic and timeless pieces of clothing and Americans are following the latest fashion trends more \u2013 you'll see so many more neutral outfits in France.\"\nWhat Do the Comments Say?\nOne user shared her own journey to French-style makeup, saying: \"My French husband HATED how much foundation I used to wear. To be honest, he was right. When I started wearing less exactly what you said my skin could breathe. I got fewer breakouts and it's downright easier to not have to put so much makeup on!\"\nAnother thought the French side gave Estopinan a more youthful look: \"Love the Paris look! Young women with beautiful skin who wear a lot of heavy coverage make themselves look older. Celebrate youthful skin while you have it!\"\nOne user, while a fan of the natural skin, felt something was missing to finish off the look: \"I like the less facial products on the face in France, but I feel like they don't do any eye makeup. I like the look of shadow, eyeliner, and mascara.\"\nUncommon Knowledge\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground."

    "text": "While we often turn to the Internet for guidance, it doesn\u2019t always have all the answers, and the same applies to trends on social media. Whether it\u2019s a new diet, a skincare hack, or an interest in alternative medicine, trends may appear harmless but might not be as safe as they seem.\nFortunately, professionals in various fields are here to share their insider knowledge and set the record straight. We\u2019ve compiled some invaluable tips from nurses, dermatologists, paramedics, surgeons, and even chefs. Ever wondered why defrosting food on the counter is a bad idea? Read on to discover more nuggets of wisdom that these experts wish everyone knew!\nRead more\n#1 Ever going to a chiropractor again.\nImage source: travelingnurse, Karolina Grabowska\nLast year, there was a 26-year-old woman in Seattle who died after a chiropractor adjusted her neck. The main danger in chiropractors is when they adjust your neck because your spinal cord is lined with your vertebral arteries. You got one on each side. And any amount of like, quick force in that area could cause those arteries to rip apart. And when those arteries rip apart, the blood that\u2019s in them tries to clot off to like stop the bleed. And when it does that, it creates a huge stroke. And that stroke goes directly to your brainstem, and brainstem strokes will kill you so fast. We can\u2019t even do anything. By the time you get to the hospital, you\u2019re screwed. I personally have taken care of two patients that had this exact scenario happen to them. But I have been in neuro ICU when we had five. Don\u2019t touch me. Don\u2019t touch my neck. Don\u2019t do it. I will never go to a chiropractor again in my life.\n#2 I would never use female hygiene products, we just don\u2019t need them.\nImage source: drrajarora, Photoholgic\nOur womanly parts are self-cleansing. And actually, we can do more harm than good if we\u2019re altering the pH by using these over-the-counter cleansers. In addition, I would not be using any perfumed products, any sprays, I would not do any douching in the area. I would just leave it alone, use simple water, and that will be more than good enough.\n#3 Go to a trampoline park.\nImage source: zemparamedic\n#4 I would never wax my skin when using retinol, retinoids, or Accutane. Retinoids lead to increased sensitivity of the skin, which could leave you with painful, irritated, almost rug-burn or chemical-like burns after waxing.\nImage source: dermguru, No Revisions\n#5 I would never pop a pimple in the danger triangle. This is the area from the bridge of the nose down to the upper lip, which forms a triangular area. Pop a pimple here, there\u2019s a chance that the bacteria from the skin can enter the bloodstream, which has a direct connection to the skull and the brain through something called a cavernous sinus. It can lead to serious infection as well as blindness or even death.\nImage source: dermguru, SpooSpa\n#6 Put my feet on the car dash.\nImage source: zemparamedic, Ljupche Vasilev\n#7 I would never have my neck manipulated by a chiropractor.\nImage source: ladyspinedoc, Toa Heftiba\n#8 If you\u2019re at someone\u2019s home or staying in a place in which you\u2019re unfamiliar, please familiarize yourself with the surroundings. I have seen so many patients that have opened doors thinking that they\u2019re walking into the bathroom, but opened doors that are going down into the basement. And we all know how that turns out.\nImage source: ladyspinedoc, Michal Balog\n#9 I would never actually put a laptop on my lap. Prolonged exposure to heat sources like laptops or heating pads can lead to a skin condition called erythema ab igne. It can lead to discoloration that can last for a very long time.\nImage source: dermguru, Kaleidico\n#10 Walk barefoot on cold cement.\nImage source: drvanessasmithhorning, Alicia Zinn\n#11 Not wear a seat belt in a car.\nImage source: zemparamedic, Kelly\n#12 Slide down a slide with a child in my lap. No seriously, stop doing this. Every year around this time when the weather\u2019s nice and people are going to the parks, there is an influx of kiddos rushed to the ER, urgent care, orthopedics office with a particular injury. \u2018Toddler\u2019s fracture,\u2019 or a spiral fracture of the tibia, which is the big bone in your lower leg. It can be caused by a twist when walking, but more commonly, it\u2019s caused when their foot gets hung between you and the slide when they\u2019re sliding down in your lap, or in a sibling\u2019s lap. They\u2019ll have pain, swelling in the shin, refusal to take a step, or even like a consistent limp. Typically there\u2019s not any bruising, and it\u2019s really hard to see on X-ray sometimes too. So the feet are out to the side, they will get hung right here and twist backwards.\nImage source: the.funny.nurse\n#13 I would not rely on Dr. Google.\nImage source: drrajarora, Valeri Mak\nSo if you have been given some resources by your doctor or health professional, of course, go ahead, read them, and they may be online, so you may use a search engine to get ahold of them. However, I wouldn\u2019t blindly type into a search engine for symptoms because this can come up with lots of different variations, lots of different diagnoses, and most of them will be anxiety-inducing and stressful to read. So if you have symptoms, it\u2019s important to go and see your doctor and to get the advice you need from a medical professional.\n#14 Propane tanks.\nImage source: travelingnurse, Isaac Moore\nThis one was really solidified this assignment. I have had three, three patients who have had propane tanks explode on them, and it has left them with debilitating burns. And the numbers have got to be wrong, got to be wrong, because I looked it up and the chances of a propane tank exploding on you are literally one in 37 million. But I have had three patients in the last few months that all had propane tanks explode. So yeah, everyone else, everyone else can handle the propane, I will simply not be participating. Simply put, I like having fingers.\n#15 Drink around a fire pit.\nImage source: zemparamedic, Wren Meinberg\n#16 I would not take antibiotics for a viral illness.\nImage source: drrajarora, Volodymyr Hryshchenko\nThey just won\u2019t work. Antibiotics only work on bacteria. They do not work on viruses. Viral illnesses need antivirals, and those will be prescribed by a doctor if deemed necessary. Or, most viral illnesses are self-limiting. If you take antibiotics and they\u2019re not needed, you\u2019re going to cause more harm than good. Lots of side effects can be associated with medicines like antibiotics. And not just that, antibiotics can also deplete your normal healthy gut bacteria that we need for immunity and for wellness. It\u2019s important to ensure that if you don\u2019t need antibiotics, don\u2019t take them unnecessarily.\n#17 Motorcycles. Even with a helmet on.\nImage source: travelingnurse, Sreenadh TC\nI\u2019m telling you right now, you are just asking for it. You could be the safest biker in the world, and I\u2019m telling you right now, you being on a highway, going highway speeds without a closed and circulating object around you is asking to get smashed like a bug.\n#18 Defrost food by leaving it on the counter. This is one of the most dangerous ways you can defrost food. It takes so long, and the outside of the food warms up to a dangerous temperature zone for an extended amount of time before the center of the core even defrosts, so the bacteria has a really great chance to grow and thrive. Best way to defrost food is in the fridge overnight. It\u2019s safe and takes up no resources. Second-best way is running under cold water, in a bucket filled with water. Yes, it does require running water, but only really, really small drops of water, just used to replace some of the water in the existing bowl and keep the temperature steady. And it\u2019s super quick, like defrosting a few chicken breasts only takes about 15 minutes. Super fast when you need it in a pinch.\nImage source: alihooke\n#19 Trim tree limbs on a ladder. When you cut that branch down, it will fall and it may fall on you.\nImage source: ladyspinedoc, Chris F\n#20 Sit with my neck exposed in front of the AC or let cold air hit me directly.\nImage source: drvanessasmithhorning, Airam Dato-on\n#21 Never leave a knife in the sink. This is something in restaurants that is widely preached, and for good reason. One of my first, actually no, my first kitchen injury was from someone leaving a knife in a sink. They\u2019re hard to see, especially if water starts covering things or other things get placed on top, and it can really do some serious damage.\nImage source: alihooke\n#22 As a skin doctor, I would never use a physical exfoliant scrub such as St. Ives or the ones you can buy over the counter at Boots or Superdrug. Most of them are way too abrasive for your skin and can cause micro tears and early skin aging.\nImage source: drrajarora\n#23 I would never participate in CrossFit.\nImage source: ladyspinedoc, Victor Freitas\n#24 If I\u2019m driving down the road, and a cute little bunny bounces in front of my car, guess what? I\u2019m going to run over the bunny. Never veer off the road trying to dart around an animal.\nImage source: ladyspinedoc, Michael Yantis\n#25 I would never go to sleep with my hair wet. Sleeping on wet hair can lead to a moist environment, which can be a breeding ground for things like bacteria and fungus. And when hair is wet, it\u2019s vulnerable since it\u2019s at its weakest state, which can lead to breakage, hair thinning, and damage to the hair follicle.\nImage source: dermguru, Chris Slupski"

    "text": "For the third year in a row, Newsweek has partnered with data intelligence platform Statista to rank the Most Trustworthy Companies in America.\nThe 2024 edition of the ranking, which is based on the results of a survey of 25,000 U.S. residents, features 700 companies across 23 industries. Retailers are the largest industry segment (with 66 companies) followed by food and beverage producers (with 50). Consumer goods, which encompass 40 companies, represent the third-largest category on the ranking.\nEvery year, different trends emerge as various companies rise and fall on the list. To showcase the companies that are making strides when it comes to consumer trust, Newsweek has identified retailers that have climbed up the list year-over-year and the food and beverage firms that finished at the top of their sector.\nNow, to help shoppers recognize the consumer brands that are gaining trust in the marketplace, Newsweek has rounded up the 21 consumer goods companies that have improved their standing since last year's Most Trustworthy Companies ranking\u2014whether they managed to leapfrog a few slots or went from not being ranked last year to appearing on this latest edition.\nThe trustworthiness of these consumer goods companies is evident from their charitable initiatives, in-touch leadership, consistent product innovation and commitment to sustainability.\nTide, a laundry detergent owned by the Procter & Gamble company, is seen on a store shelf on October 20, 2020, in Miami. Procter & Gamble was included in the consumer goods portion of Newsweek's... Joe Raedle/Getty Images \nProcter & Gamble\nThe No. 1 most trusted consumer goods company this year, Procter & Gamble, moved up seven spots from No. 8 last year.\nThe multinational company is seen as trustworthy not just for the products it sells, but also for the charitable causes it supports.P&G, which makes brands including Pampers, Tide, Crest and Febreze, made headlines in March when it came to the aid of victims of tornadoes in Ohio and Indiana by offering free mobile laundry and shower services to area residents.\nThe company is also looking to engage with customers via its rewards program called P&G Good Everyday, where customers can complete surveys, take quizzes or scan receipts to earn points that can be used on gift cards, sweepstakes entries or donations to a preferred cause. Donation recipients include initiatives like It's Our Home, which advocates for youth environmental education, or Loads of Hope, which provides detergent to people in need.\nColgate-Palmolive\nColgate-Palmolive, in the second spot among consumer goods companies on this year's ranking, moved up from No. 5 last year. The company, besides its namesake Colgate toothpaste and Palmolive soap, is also behind brands such as Speed Stick, Irish Spring and Hill's Pet Nutrition.\nLike P&G, Colgate-Palmolive touts its community focus. The company's website points to its initiatives to provide free oral health education and dental care in over 80 countries, donate pet food to shelters, and help supply meals, afterschool tutoring and sports programs for youth in Mexico.\nEarlier this month, the company announced that it had been honored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy for the 14th consecutive year, earning an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award for its achievements in energy efficiency.\nSC Johnson\nSC Johnson was the biggest year-over-year climber that was also ranked last year in the consumer goods section, rising from 22nd place to No. 7 this year. The Wisconsin-based private company\u2014its website reminds you that it's a family company in its logo\u2014makes Windex, Raid, Pledge and other household staples.\nIn March, SC Johnson CEO Fisk Johnson testified in a congressional hearing about the need for federal-level extended producer responsibility, a policy approach that holds product makers responsible for an item's post-consumer environmental considerations.\nJohnson told the representatives, \"I believe plastic waste is a critical issue that needs to be addressed in a practical, good way to make substantive progresses through a national regulatory framework, where you can achieve scale with producers taking responsibility for the life cycle of their products.\"\nIgloo\nThe No. 8 consumer goods company on the list, Igloo, was the highest-placed brand that was entirely unranked last year. The company's popular coolers can be found on any beach or along for the ride on any road trip.\nWhat may be less well-known about the company, though, is its wide range of \"coolaborations.\" Consumers can get Igloo coolers co-branded with Peanuts drawings, Star Wars characters and music acts like Green Day and the Wu-Tang Clan.\nIn January, the company entered the active cooler space with the debut of its ICF Series, a collection of iceless electric compressor coolers. These coolers give the owner temperature control anywhere from 0 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit without ice.\nA selection of vintage Igloo coolers at Igloo Products Corp. on March 1, 2012, in Katy, Texas. Igloo was ranked among Newsweek's Most Trustworthy Companies in America. James Nielsen/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images \nSteinway & Sons\nPiano maker Steinway & Sons landed at No. 11 after being unranked last year. In October, the company, which has been producing pianos for more than 170 years, announced a collaboration with Disney to produce a limited edition piano displaying images of Mickey Mouse, one of its many piano varieties in its long history.\nThe company's other collaborations show the breadth of its pianos' appeal. It has had partnerships with Swiss luxury travel brand Explora Journeys to provide pianos for cruise ship entertainment and with rocker Lenny Kravitz to provide a $50,000 donation to the Harlem School of the Arts. Singer Rufus Wainwright participated in the launch of the Gran Nichetto piano, itself a collaboration with Italy- and Sweden-based designer Luca Nichetto.\nYankee Candle\nNo. 12 on the list, Yankee Candle, was also absent from last year's ranking. The company, responsible for everyone's mom's favorite flavor of candle, was started in 1969 when 16-year-old Mike Kittredge melted Crayons to make his mother a candle for Christmas, a gift that he instead sold to a neighbor.\nToday, Yankee Candle makes more than 600 candle fragrances (including aromas like aloe & agave, pink cherry & vanilla, and Bahama breeze) as well as home and car fragrance products, and candle accents and accessories. The company has a massive retail footprint: It has more than 300 company-owned stores nationwide and a network that includes more than 14,000 specialty U.S. retailers.\nTupperware\nUbiquitous container maker Tupperware finished at No. 13 on the list this year, after being unranked in 2023. The company has a history that dovetails with the evolution of the typical American residential kitchen, from the first Tupperware parties in the 1940s through '70s-era catalogs offering products in four basic colors, to a partnership with Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, a chemical manufacturer, to design products made from mixed plastic waste in the 2010s.\nIn October, the publicly traded company made waves by bringing in Laurie Ann Goldman as the new company president and CEO. Goldman is a consumer products giant who has served as CEO of Spanx, Avon North America and most recently of medical aesthetics brand OVME, and in various leadership roles at Coca-Cola for more than a decade.\nTupperware products are offered for sale at a retail store on April 10, 2023, in Chicago. Tupperware was included on the 2024 ranking of the Most Trustworthy Companies in America. Scott Olson/Getty Images \nKlein Tools\nNo. 15 on this year's list, Illinois-based Klein Tools was also unranked last year. The company, founded in 1857, is a product-making machine. In February alone, it released a new line of face shields, new hollow nut drivers (which look like a cross between a screwdriver and a ratchet), its Premium Meter Electrical Test Kit, a 64-piece ratchet and driver system, and new carbon fiber hard hats. In January, it released nine new products.\nThomas R. Klein is the chairman and CEO of Klein Tools, which has been overseen by six generations of the Klein family since its founding. The company operates a family of businesses that includes Klein Cutlery, which it says is the largest U.S. manufacturer of hot-forged scissors and shears, and Brazilian equipment producer Civitella.\nDelta Faucet\n\"Passion flows\" at the No. 17 consumer goods company on the list, Delta Faucet, which wasn't on last year's ranking. The company may be larger than you realize\u2014it owns the Brizo, Kraus, Peerless, First Wave, Steamist and eponymous Delta brands, employs more than 3,000 people worldwide and has over 2,100 granted U.S. patents.\nDelta Faucet focuses on charity by giving monetary and product donations to organizations like Habitat for Humanity and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and via financial support to the United Way of Central Indiana. The company also says it strives to make products that help conserve water, such as faucets that use Delta VoiceIQ Technology, which can fill a container to a precise measurement, even from across a room via hands-free command activation.\nSteelcase\nWorkplace design company Steelcase rose three spots on the list since last year, climbing from No. 23 to No. 20 in 2024. The Michigan-based firm makes everything you might see in a professional setting: office chairs, workstations, conference tables, whiteboards and other business-y furnishings.\nAlthough you might not recognize the company's name, its products are everywhere, and its bottom line proves it: Its fiscal year 2024 revenue totaled $3.2 billion. On April 2, the company introduced a new design of its Think office chair that infuses residential qualities (such as plush upholstery and warm-toned visual styles) \"to meet the needs of the modern, hybrid worker.\"\n\"Prior to the pandemic, your workplace and your home looked and felt different from a color and material perspective,\" Kaitlyn Gillmor, Steelcase senior industrial designer, said about the new design in an April news release. \"Those spaces are now blurred, so they need to provide a similar level of comfort.\"\nBatesville\nBatesville, a leader in the death care industry, landed at No. 22 this year after being unranked last year. The company, based in Batesville, Indiana, and founded in 1884, specializes in burial and cremation products and memorial keepsakes, but it also operates its Living Memorial tree-planting program.\nFamilies who participate in the Living Memorial program receive a letter of condolence with a certificate acknowledging a tree will be planted in memory of a deceased loved one.\nStarted in 1976, the program is now responsible for the planting of 14.5 million trees. Batesville says it is one of the country's most impactful private reforestation initiatives and has helped re-establish parts of national forests and woodlands destroyed by forest fires and other natural disasters.\nYETI\nThe No. 24 most trustworthy consumer goods company, YETI, a designer, retailer and distributor of outdoor-related products, was also absent from the 2023 list. Founded in 2006, it's a relatively young company compared to the others on the list, but its rise has been quick\u2014its full-year 2023 sales totaled nearly $1.66 billion, up 4 percent from the previous year.\nThe range of YETI products is wide; it offers items like coolers, bags, buckets, blankets and dog bowls, all designed for outdoor use. Most unique, though, is its website's emphasis on outdoor-themed nonfiction articles about how to best tackle voyaging through faraway places, like \"How to Pack for 10 Days on the Bering Sea\" and \"Mexico's Liquid Heritage,\" which is about the world of agave spirits.\nLibbey\nThe next company on the list makes the sort of glassware that would be perfect for those kinds of mixed drinks. Libbey, which has been in business since 1818 and says it was the first company to use automatic machinery to produce lightbulbs, calls itself \"the vanguard of artistry and innovation in glassmaking.\" Absent from the 2023 list, the company is now ranked at No. 25.\nBesides glass bakeware, vases and dinner settings, the company makes drinkware for everyday uses, but its most interesting items are the glasses especially made for different drink categories\u2014it offers margarita and whiskey glasses, and martini, beer and wine glasses of various bendy shapes.\nAll of it is made with an environmental focus that sees every piece started with about 30 percent pre-consumer recycled glass.\nMercury Marine\nMercury Marine, a company that was unranked last year that landed at No. 26 this year, makes propulsion equipment for motorboats, including engines, propellers and control displays. The company, which is a division of global boating behemoth Brunswick, has been making outboard motors since 1939. It lists its boating innovations on its website, including the release of the industry's first V10 outboard in 2022.\nLast month, the company celebrated 50 years of its racing team, which hit the five-decade mark in 2023, by looking back at the previous year's festivities marking the anniversary. The culmination of the year was the June launch of the company's 500R engine, which it calls \"the most powerful and technologically advanced outboard available for performance sport boats.\"\nTempur Sealy International\nTempur Sealy International, the self-proclaimed world's largest bedding provider, owns well-known brands like Tempur-Pedic and Stearns & Foster. This year, the bedroom juggernaut landed at No. 27 after being unranked in 2023. Tempur Sealy plans to become even larger in 2024: It expects to finalize its acquisition of retailer Mattress Firm in the second half of this year.\nBesides acquiring Mattress Firm, which will continue as a multi-branded retailer post-closing, Tempur Sealy is also making moves in its products department this year.\nIn January, it announced its new Tempur-ActiveBreeze Smart Bed. The bed offers customizable climate programs that change its temperature to best suit each customer's sleep schedule. Additionally, the new ActiveBreeze Smart Bed will include relaxation programs\u2014the company's WaveForm Massage and SoundScape features\u2014that were introduced in 2023.\nWarby Parker\nEyewear brand Warby Parker landed at the 29th spot on the ranking this year; it didn't appear at all last year.\nStarted in 2010, the company (which maintains 208 locations, according to its 2022 impact report) shows its good-natured side with its Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program that distributes a pair of glasses to someone in need for every pair of glasses or sunglasses that the company sells. So far, the program has delivered more than 15 million pairs of glasses worldwide.\nIn 2019, the company established the Warby Parker Impact Foundation, a nonprofit with the mission of helping people overcome barriers preventing them from receiving quality eye care. The foundation advocates for legislative changes at the local, state, national and global level, and the company says it builds upon the efforts of its Buy a Pair, Give a Pair program.\nLifetime Brands\nLifetime Brands, which was ranked 33rd this year after being absent last year, is a maker of kitchenware, tableware and other products for use in the home. The company, founded in 1945, is responsible for such well-known brands as KitchenAid, Farberware and Sabatier.\nLifetime Brands specializes in products you don't realize you need until you see them. Its 2024 lookbook includes gadgets like an all-in-one cutting and charcuterie board that has space for preparation on one side and recessed compartments for arranging your items on the other. A \"SnackleBox\" takes a cue from tackle boxes with a single unit designed to easily transport a variety of foods. And the \"Versatong\" is like an ordinary pair of tongs except that the ends have \"finger-like grabbers\" made of silicone, intended for gripping food without breaking it.\nFlexsteel\nFurniture maker Flexsteel was ranked 34th this year after also being absent from last year's list. The Iowa-based company, which began as the Rolph & Ball Furniture Company in 1893, specializes in all sorts of home furnishings: living room, bedroom, kitchen and dining, and home office.\nOn March 27, the company announced that it was transforming its best-selling indoor Sky furniture collection into an outdoor set featuring weather-resistant sofas, chairs, ottomans and sectional pieces.\nBeyond product innovations, the company also has sustainability-focused priorities, most recently demonstrated by a partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation that aims to plant 13,000 trees in the southeastern U.S. by July of this year. The company has also made a longer commitment to plant a tree for every Flex sectional sold through the end of June 2025.\nFreshpet\nSustainability is also a priority for No. 36 on the list, Freshpet, which didn't rank in 2023. The pet food maker (which says it delivers \"food food\"\u2014as opposed to \"dog food\"\u2014for four-legged consumers) boasts about its green achievements on its website, including its commitment to using renewable energy to make and store its offerings. That commitment resulted in the prevention of nearly 49,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2022, according to the company.\nBeyond its eponymous pet food, the company owns brands like Vital, Homestyle Creations and the all-plant Spring & Sprout. For its pet food brands, the company promises farm-fresh fruits and vegetables and high-quality proteins in meals that are steam-cooked \"to lock in vital nutrients.\" The company also says the resulting pet meals undergo more than 20 quality and safety tests before leaving its kitchens.\nGeorgia-Pacific\nAtlanta-based Georgia-Pacific, one of the world's biggest manufacturers of paper- and forest-related products, landed at No. 37 this year after being unranked last year. The company owns brands like Quilted Northern, Angel Soft, Brawny and Dixie.\nEverything about GP is huge. In 2023 alone, the company made about $2 billion in capital improvements that included completing a new facility in Tennessee and making upgrades at company locations in Wisconsin and Texas, among other projects reaching from South Carolina to Oregon.\nThe company, though, keeps responsible sourcing top of mind: Its 2023 Stewardship Report says more than 90 percent of the fresh fiber in its products is grown in the U.S., \"where landowners employ best management practices to act as proper stewards of the forests, water, and biodiversity.\"\nNeutrogena\nSkincare brand Neutrogena was the final climber in the top 40, reaching No. 38 after being entirely unranked last year.\nRather uniquely among companies on this list, Neutrogena, which is a division of Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., has its own media studio that produces short films. Its website currently features \"En Avant,\" about a Black ballerina struggling with self-acceptance in a white-dominated art form.\nBeyond making its wide range of skin-focused products, the company also counts advocacy as one of its pillars by \"championing skin care and skin science for all tones and types.\" It says 62 percent of U.S. adults face some form of skin health inequality. To help connect the right products with an individual's unique complexion, Neutrogena offers the Skin360 virtual skin analysis tool on its website, which uses an uploaded scan of a customer's face to recommend products and ingredients to reach their skincare goals.\nUncommon Knowledge\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground."

    "text": "NEWARK, Del, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The anti-acne dermal patch market is expected to reach US$ 586.3 million by 2024. The market size is expected to reach US$ 1.1 billion by 2034, projected at a CAGR of 6.5%. The acne bacterium propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) often causes acne, a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Topical treatment for acne using hydrocolloid or hydrogel patches has become increasingly popular.\nA common substance used for medical dressings is hydrocolloid or hydrogel, also commonly used in anti-acne patches. With social networking sites extensively promoting anti-acne patches, their acceptance and demand have grown. Social media platforms have made these products more visible and have become a driving force behind consumer behavior.\nGenerally, microneedle patches are more expensive than hydrogel patches for treating acne because hydrogel patches are waterproof and can absorb fluid, causing pimples to flatten, and are more cost-effective.\nRequest for a sample of this research report: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-19247\nContinuous research and development have been conducted to improve their convenience and effectiveness. Anti-acne dermal patches using new active ingredients have been developed to address different areas of acne pathogenesis. Complex delivery mechanisms have also been developed.\nResearchers are investigating the effects of retinoids, niacinamide, and peptides on the reduction of acne lesions and prevention of recurrence using dermal patches because of their anti-inflammatory and skin-regenerating properties. A new generation of patch designs, such as hydrocolloid dressings and microneedling, offer both occlusive and wound-healing properties while improving the effectiveness of active chemicals.\nEfforts are also being made to develop intelligent dermal patches that monitor skin problems in real-time, provide real-time therapy updates, and provide customized treatments. Increasing the precision, effectiveness, and accessibility of acne treatment is one of the greatest benefits these developments bring to patients.\nAdvancements in patch technology have completely transformed the market for anti-acne therapies. Using microneedle technology, active substances can be penetrated deeper into the skin and distributed more effectively. Dermal patches now include hydrocolloid dressings, which are known to heal wounds in order to provide occlusive benefits and the ability to keep wounds moist. Besides improving the therapeutic effectiveness of the anti-acne dermal patches, these developments also improve patient comfort and compliance.\nKey Takeaways from the Market Study\nThe chemical based segment is expected to expand at 6.3% CAGR by 2034.\nThe United States is estimated to register at a CAGR of 6.8% by 2034.\nAn 11.9% CAGR was recorded between 2019 and 2023 for Japan's market.\nChina is experiencing rapid growth, predicted at a CAGR of 7.1% by 2034.\nThe 18 years to 44 years segment is anticipated to expand at 6.1% CAGR by 2034.\n\u201cBeauty industries are growing, resulting in a rise in personalized care products, which will, in turn, drive the demand for Anti-acne dermal patches market,\u201d says Sneha Verghese, Senior Consultant for Consumer Goods and Products at Future Market Insights\nGain Immediate Access to Detailed Market Insights: https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/checkout/19247\nCompetitive Landscape\nGlobal and regional players dominate the anti-acne dermal patches market.

    "text": "Dublin, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"A2 Milk Market Report by End-Use (Liquid Milk, Infant Formula, and Others), Distribution Channel (Supermarkets and Hypermarkets, Convenience and Grocery Stores, Online/Non-Store Retailing, and Others), and Region 2024-2032\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\nThe global A2 milk market size reached US$ 13.4 billion in 2023. The market is projected to reach US$ 47.8 billion by 2032, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 15.2% during 2023-2032\nThe increasing lactose intolerant population, rising inclination towards A2 milk-based processed and RTE food products, and the growing number of commercial establishments, including cafes and bakeries, are some of the major factors propelling the market. \nThe increasing lactose intolerant population is driving the demand for A2 milk to meet the daily nutritional needs of the body around the world. Moreover, the rising inclination towards A2 milk-based processed and ready to eat (RTE) food products, such as pancakes, muffins, cupcakes, smoothies, shakes, and coffee, on account of rapid urbanization, busy lifestyles, and improving purchasing power of consumers is favoring the growth of the market.\nThe leading companies are using genetic testing to identify cows that produce A2-only protein, which ensures that the milk is genuinely of the A2 variety and maintains the integrity of the product. They are also utilizing mass spectrometry and advanced chromatography technologies for stringent quality checks, which help in confirming the absence of A1 proteins and ensuring the purity of A2 milk.\nMoreover, key players are integrating blockchain technology and QR codes to enhance traceability and allow consumers to access detailed information about the journey of the product from farm to shelf, thereby increasing consumer trust. They are also ensuring that A2 milk maintains its quality while being transported over long distances.\nIn addition, the growing number of commercial establishments, including cafes, restaurants, hotels, quick service restaurants (QSRs), and bakeries, which are incorporating the use of A2 milk in the preparation of food and beverages is influencing the market positively. Apart from this, the easy availability of A2 milk and A2 milk based food products and drinks via different online retail channels like grocery or food delivery applications, as they offer convenience and fast and free shipping facilities, are contributing to the market growth.\nFurthermore, increasing use of A2 milk in the production of cosmetic and skincare products, such as lotions, cleansers, moisturizers, shampoos, and conditioners, are bolstering the market growth.\nA2 Milk Market Trends/Drivers\nIncrease in awareness about associated benefits\nOne of the primary factors driving the demand for A2 milk is the growing consumer awareness about its health benefits. Unlike regular cow's milk, which contains both A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins, A2 milk contains only A2 beta-casein. Research has indicated that A2 milk is easier to digest for some individuals, potentially reducing symptoms associated with lactose intolerance and milk sensitivities. This perceived health advantage has been communicated effectively through various media channels, leading to increased consumer interest and subsequent demand for A2 milk.\nRise in lifestyle diseases\nWith lifestyle-related health issues such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease on the rise, consumers are becoming increasingly cautious about their dietary choices. A2 milk is often seen as a healthier alternative to regular milk because it lacks the A1 protein, which has been linked to some digestive issues and inflammation. As people look for better and nutritious options that align with a balanced lifestyle, A2 milk is gaining popularity, fulfilling this consumer need for wellness-focused food products.\nGrowing consumer preferences\nAs consumer preferences evolve toward natural, organic, and ethical choices, A2 milk is enjoying increased attention. Many A2 milk brands promote their products as not only easier on digestion but also produced in environmentally responsible ways. Some even highlight better animal welfare practices, like free-range and grass-fed cows, which appeal to a consumer base concerned with sustainability and ethical considerations. This aligns with the broader trend of health-conscious consumption, wherein people are willing to pay a premium for products that they perceive to be better for their health and the planet. As this trend continues, the demand for A2 milk is likely to sustain its upward trajectory.\nKey Questions Answered in This Report\nWhat is the size of the global A2 milk market in 2023?\nWhat is the expected growth rate of the global A2 milk market during 2024-2032?\nWhat are the key factors driving the global A2 milk market?\nWhat has been the impact of COVID-19 on the global A2 milk market?\nWhat is the breakup of the global A2 milk market based on the end-use?\nWhat is the breakup of the global A2 milk market based on the distribution channel?\nWhat are the key regions in the global A2 milk market?\nWho are the key players/companies in the global A2 milk market?\nKey Attributes:\nReport Attribute\tDetails\t\nNo. of Pages\t146\t\nForecast Period\t2023 - 2032\t\nEstimated Market Value (USD) in 2023\t$13.4 Billion\t\nForecasted Market Value (USD) by 2032\t$47.8 Billion\t\nCompound Annual Growth Rate\t15.2%\t\nRegions Covered\tGlobal\t\nCompetition Analysis\nThe A2 Milk Company Limited\nJersey Dairy\nLion Pty Limited (Pura and Dairy Farmers)\nFonterra\nA2 Milk Industry Segmentation:\nBreakup by End-Use:\nLiquid Milk\nInfant Formula\nOthers\nBreakup by Distribution Channel:\nSupermarkets and Hypermarkets\nConvenience and Grocery Stores\nOnline/Non-store Retailing\nOthers\nBreakup by Region:\nNorth America\nEurope\nOceania\nAsia\nOthers\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/i1zqn5\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

    "text": "On Tuesday, Piper Sandler maintained its Overweight rating on Kenvue Inc (NYSE:NYSE:) with a steady stock price target of $20.00. The firm acknowledged Kenvue's effective marketing strategies within its Skin Health and Beauty segment, noting significant brand advancements.\nNeutrogena and Aveeno, two of the company's skincare brands, have seen an increase in consumer preference rankings. Neutrogena rose to become the No. 6 preferred skincare brand, while Aveeno climbed to the No. 15 spot.\nThe company's success extended to the haircare sector, with its OGX brand ascending three positions to rank as the No. 17 favorite haircare brand. This growth is attributed to a surge in spending among female teenagers, particularly in haircare products. Piper Sandler's assessment reflects the positive consumer reception and increased market penetration of Kenvue's brands.\nKenvue's recent marketing initiatives are bearing fruit, as evidenced by the upward movement of its brands in consumer preference rankings. The analyst from Piper Sandler highlighted that the company's targeted efforts have resulted in Neutrogena and Aveeno each moving up one slot from their Fall positions.\nOGX's rise by three slots further demonstrates the effectiveness of Kenvue's strategy in appealing to the teen demographic.\nThe focus on the female teen market segment has been particularly beneficial for Kenvue's haircare category. The sustained growth in this demographic's spending habits supports the company's position and the analyst's reiterated price target. Kenvue's strategic marketing and product placement continue to contribute to its strong presence in the competitive beauty and personal care industry.\nPiper Sandler's reiteration of the $20.00 stock price target on Kenvue Inc reflects confidence in the company's ongoing marketing strategies and their impact on brand preference and consumer spending. The firm's analysis suggests that Kenvue's efforts to enhance its brand positioning are successfully translating into tangible growth within key product segments.\nInvestingPro Insights\nAs Kenvue Inc (NYSE:KVUE) continues to make strides in the beauty and personal care industry, real-time metrics from InvestingPro provide a detailed snapshot of the company's financial health. Kenvue boasts an impressive gross profit margin of 55.96% for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023, underscoring the firm's efficiency in managing production costs and pricing strategies.\nThis aligns with Piper Sandler's positive outlook on the company's marketing strategies and brand advancements.\nDespite recent successes, two analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, suggesting that investors should keep a close eye on future earnings reports and market trends.\nMoreover, Kenvue operates with a moderate level of debt, which could impact its financial flexibility and investment capacity. Still, the company's profitability over the last twelve months and the prediction that it will remain profitable this year provide reassurance regarding its financial stability.\nThe InvestingPro data further illustrates the company's market position with a market capitalization of $38.41 billion and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.23, adjusted for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023. These figures, coupled with a dividend yield of 3.99% as of the latest dividend ex-date, present a mixed yet intriguing picture for potential investors.\nFor more insights, including additional InvestingPro Tips that could guide investment decisions, visit https://www.investing.com/pro/KVUE.

North America follows with the second-largest share in the global personal care and cosmetics preservatives market. Personal hygiene products held the largest share by application. However, skincare products are projected to record the fastest demand growth for preservatives during the forecast period due to rising consumer awareness and per capita expenditure on these products.\nResearch Scope\nIn this report, growth opportunities for preservatives in the personal care and cosmetics industry are assessed.

Over the first half of 2023, on a comparable basis, Milk Makeup delivered strong Combined Milk Net Revenue growth of +35.7% and Milk Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 million, compared with $8.1 million in the first half of 2022, a trend we saw continue into the second half of 2023. Obagi Skincare\u2019s performance was mixed with Net Revenue growth in the core U.S. physician dispensed business overshadowed by lower Net Revenue from the planned restructuring of certain channels in the U.S. and from operations in Southeast Asia due to the previously announced delays in obtaining product registrations. Shipments in Southeast Asia resumed in the second half of 2023, however, the ramp in revenue was slower than originally anticipated. That said, we are very excited about the growth prospects for the region as we establish a new and more robust go-to market structure for Obagi Skincare's business in Southeast Asia that will ramp up over the next 18 months.\u201d\n\u201cFor the full fiscal year 2023, we expect to deliver Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue growth in the mid-teens, and to yield significant advancement in profitability with Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the 10-12% range. While our fiscal 2023 results are expected to trail our original expectations, we believe that the changes made during 2023 will position us well to continue to achieve the on-going structural economics of our business model in 2024 with continued improvements of our Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Margin relative to 2023 guidance levels. This conviction is strengthened by the performance we have seen in the first couple of months of 2024 driven by strong innovation across both brands, particularly the launches of Milk Makeup Cooling Water Jelly Tints and Obagi Skincare's Hydro-Drops\u00aeEye Gel.\u201d\nFirst Half Fiscal 2023 Highlights\nOn July 27, 2022 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), Waldencast consummated the business combination (\u201cBusiness Combination\u201d) with Obagi Global Holdings Limited (\u201cObagi Skincare\u201d) and Milk Makeup LLC (\u201cMilk Makeup\u201d). The results below set out certain key performance highlights for the business for the periods presented in the H1 2023 Interim Financials. When reading the H1 2023 Interim Financials and this release, you should note there is a clear division between the \u201cpredecessor\u201d periods that include consolidated financial statements up to the Closing Date and \u201csuccessor\u201d periods that include all periods after the acquisition date. The predecessor and successor results shown on a U.S. GAAP basis are not comparable, as the successor period includes the consolidated financial statements of Waldencast, Obagi Skincare and Milk Makeup, whereas the predecessor period includes only Obagi Skincare\u2019s financial statements. We have included U.S. GAAP numbers for the period H2 2022 but note that they are presented primarily to inform the components of the non-GAAP metrics and do not allow for comparability for the periods presented for the reasons stated above. Please refer to our 2022 20-F filed with the SEC on January 16, 2024 for further information on our key accounting policies and restatements related to 2021 and 2020. Please also refer to the definitions and reconciliations set out further in this release with respect to certain adjusted non-GAAP measures discussed below which are included to provide an easier understanding of the underlying performance of the business given the above. \nWaldencast\nGroup Net Revenue: U.S. GAAP Net Revenue was $109.3 million in the first half of 2023, and $68.3 million in the first half of 2022.\nCombined Comparable Group Net Revenue: Removing the China Business and including Milk Makeup in the comparable period for the first half of 2022, Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue was $106.0 million in the first half of 2023, up 5.1% from $100.8 million in the first half of 2022.\nGroup Net Income/Loss and Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss was $(36.8) million during the first half of 2023, and $(17.6) million during the first half of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.9 million in the first half of 2023, and $(0.5) million during the first half of 2022.\nGroup Combined Adjusted EBITDA: Combined Adjusted EBITDA was $13.9 million (12.7% Adjusted EBITDA Margin) during the first half of 2023, compared with $7.6 million during the first half of 2022.\nObagi Skincare: For Obagi Skincare, U.S. GAAP Net Revenue was $57.0 million in the first half of 2023, compared with $68.3 million in the first half of 2022. Comparable Obagi Net Revenue was $53.7 million in the first half of 2023, down 13.8% vs. $62.2 million in the first half of 2022. The reduction in revenue was related primarily to the loss in revenue related to the Southeast Asia distributor (-$9.3m) and lower revenue recognized in connection with Obagi Skincare\u2019s Amazon distributor (-$2.2m) resulting from the decision to pivot to a direct distribution model and the termination of the agreement in place with the Amazon distributor. Offsetting these impacts, Obagi.com grew 80.9%, from $2.9 million in the first half of 2022 to $5.3 million in the first half of 2023 and International distributors (excluding Southeast Asia) grew 20.7% to $8.4 million in the same period. Obagi Skincare recorded a Net Loss of $(12.2) million in H1 2023. Obagi Skincare Adjusted EBITDA was $9.6 million (16.9% Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2023, compared with $(0.5) million (-0.7% Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2022 which was achieved in part due to the fact that revenue in the first half of 2023 from the Southeast Asia distributor had better margins as a result of the cash basis revenue recognition accounting compared to the first half of 2022 where margins were adversely impacted by shipments being greater than cash collected.\nMilk Makeup: For Milk Makeup U.S. GAAP Net Revenue was $52.3 million in the first half of 2023. Combined Milk Net Revenue was $38.5 million for the first half of 2022, resulting in a 35.7% growth across periods on a comparable basis. Milk Makeup recorded a Net Loss of $(0.7) million in H1 2023. Milk Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 million (24.3% Adjusted EBITDA Margin), compared with $8.1 million in the first half of 2022 driven by continued strong sales growth globally and improving gross margin.\nLiquidity: At June 30, 2023, Waldencast had $18.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $196.5 million. Total cash flow in the period January 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023 was $10.2 million, including a $35 million draw down on the revolving credit facilities. The revolving credit facility was fully repaid using the proceeds from the private placement conducted by Waldencast in September 2023 and remained undrawn until the end of fiscal 2023.\nOutstanding shares: As of June 30, 2023, the Company had 108,016,112 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 87,032,559 Class A ordinary shares outstanding and 20,983,553 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 122,076,410 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 101,228,857 Class A ordinary shares outstanding and 20,847,553 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. Fully Diluted Shares increased to 129,695,296 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily driven by 14,000,000 million additional Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the September 2023 private placement and 2,760,000 million ordinary shares granted as equity awards to employees. As of December 31, 2023, 70,245,039 Class A ordinary shares remain subject to contractual lock-up arrangements entered into in connection with the September 2023 private placement, of which (i) 10,401,884 were locked until March 14, 2024, (ii) 7,159,376 are locked until May 8, 2024, (iii) 31,205,649 are locked until September 14, 2024 and (iv) 21,478,130 are locked until November 8, 2024. Contractual lock-ups previously applying to former members of Milk Makeup and founders expired during the course of 2023. Further details regarding the duration of these lock-ups are set forth in our 2022 20-F.\nThe publication of the H1 2023 Interim Financials marks an important milestone for Waldencast in regaining compliance with Nasdaq reporting requirements and satisfaction of the conditions granted by the hearing panel. Waldencast looks forward to providing further updates on FY 2023 performance in connection with the publication of its 2023 20-F. In connection with the restatement of prior financial statements described in further detail below, Waldencast also published restated financials for Obagi Skincare for the period ended March 31, 2022 as required under securities regulations.\nObagi Skincare\nObagi Skincare is a flagship well established brand in the physician dispensed market, one of the most attractive sub-segments of premium skin care in the U.S. With its breakthrough technology and transformative clinically proven results, Obagi Skincare unlocks high loyalty from both consumers and physicians, and we believe is well positioned to answer the growing consumer need for high performance effective skin care, while also paving the way for Obagi Skincare to expand into other categories.\nIn the first half of 2023, Obagi Skincare reset its strategy and plans in the key strategic region of Southeast Asia through the acquisition of the Vietnam operations of the legacy Southeast Asia distributor and setting up the infrastructure to support a direct distribution model in the region, which is approximately 10 times the size of the Vietnam market. The skincare market in Southeast Asia is approximately $11 billion1 and growing rapidly and the Obagi Skincare brand has achieved widespread support from the dermatological community in the region. As part of this initiative, Obagi Skincare accelerated its organizational transformation in Southeast Asia with the appointment of a new management team. In connection with the restructuring of Obagi Skincare\u2019s business in Southeast Asia, in 2023 management also decided to discontinue the Obagi Clinical range and focus on selling the flagship Obagi Medical range in the region. Beyond Southeast Asia, a number of initiatives were also implemented during the course of 2023 designed to reposition the business for future success, led by a new management team which was announced in H2 2023.\nIn the first half of 2023 Obagi Skincare achieved U.S. GAAP Net Revenue of $57.0 million, compared with $68.3 million in the first half of 2022. Excluding sales from the China Business, Obagi Skincare delivered Comparable Obagi Net Revenue of $53.7 million in the first half of 2023, down 13.8% vs. $62.2 million in the first half of 2022. The reduction in revenue was related in part to the loss in revenue related to the Southeast Asia distributor (-$9.3m) and in part to lower revenue recognized in connection with Obagi Skincare\u2019s Amazon distributor (-$2.2m) resulting from the decision to pivot to a direct distribution model and the termination of the agreement in place with the Amazon distributor. Offsetting these impacts, Obagi.com grew 80.9%, from $2.9m million in the first half of 2022 to $5.3 million in the first half of 2023 and International distributors (excluding Southeast Asia) grew 20.7% to $8.4 million in the same period. Obagi Skincare recorded a U.S. GAAP Net Loss of $(12.2) million in the first half of 2023. Obagi Adjusted EBITDA was $9.6 million (16.9% Obagi Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2023, compared with $(0.5) million (-0.7% Obagi Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2022 which was achieved in part due to the fact that revenue in the first half of 2023 from the Southeast Asia distributor had better margins as a result of the cash basis revenue recognition accounting compared to the first half of 2022 where margins were adversely impacted by shipments being greater than cash collected.\nAs previously reported, in the first half of 2023, the Company implemented a series of initiatives relating to the Obagi Skincare business model in order to be better positioned to capture the opportunities in one of the fastest growing sub-segments of the skincare premium market. Obagi Skincare remains focused on the U.S. physician channel business, with a large healthcare professional account base consisting of more than 5,300 active medical provider accounts as of March 2024, and management estimates there are approximately 18,800 licensed physicians comprising licensed dermatologists and licensed cosmetic surgeons, resulting in broad distribution of Obagi products.\n__________________________\n\u00b9 Source: Sales value of skin care in Southeast Asia* (USD Million) in 2023, Euromonitor, KPMG Analysis. Note: Southeast Asia countries include 9 countries, namely Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\nMilk Makeup\nMilk Makeup is a leading, award winning, prestige, clean makeup brand with unique products, a strong following among Gen-Z consumers and a growing global presence. Milk Makeup has built an organic following through a diverse and inclusive community known for its cultural relevance and iconic products. In the first half of 2023, Milk Makeup was the number 2 clean brand at Sephora U.S., bringing a relevant promise of cool, clean, makeup that works.\nThis translated into a strong financial performance with Milk delivering in the first half of 2023 U.S. GAAP Net Revenue of $52.3 million, a gross margin of 62.8% and Net Loss of $(0.7) million. Milk Adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 million (24.3%) in the first half of 2023, compared with $8.1 million in the first half of 2022 driven by continued strong sales growth globally and improving gross margin.\nIn the first half of 2023, Milk Makeup advanced on its key strategic goals via:\nSuccessfully bringing market leading innovation with two high profile launches Pore Eclipse Powder and Contouring Sticks (successful extension to existing strong Pillars Pore Eclipse and Sticks);\nDelivering high impact awareness by driving marketing campaigns both digitally on social media (e.g. TikTok) and through physical campaigns reaching their community in relevant touchpoints with relevant messaging; and\nExpanding into high demand markets such as the U.K. with the launch into Space NK and being a brand anchor of the highly publicized Sephora brick and mortar launch in the U.K.\nFinancial Overview \nIn accounting for the Business Combination, Waldencast was deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and Obagi Skincare was deemed to be the predecessor entity for purposes of financial reporting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, Waldencast\u2019s assets and liabilities retained their carrying values and the assets and liabilities associated with Obagi Skincare and Milk Makeup were recorded at their fair values measured as of the acquisition date, which created a new basis of accounting.\nWhen reading the H1 2023 Interim Financials and this release, you should note there is a clear division between the \u201cpredecessor\u201d periods that include consolidated financial statements up to the Closing Date and \u201csuccessor\u201d periods that include all periods after the acquisition date. The predecessor and successor results shown are not comparable, as the successor period includes the consolidated financial statements of Waldencast, Obagi Skincare, and Milk Makeup, whereas the predecessor period includes only Obagi Skincare\u2019s financial statements.\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, during the year ended December 31, 2023, management of the Company and the audit committee of Waldencast\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d), with the assistance of legal and accounting advisors, conducted an internal review of certain accounting issues related to the recognition of revenue in Predecessor Periods, including issues related to the recognition of revenue from sales of Obagi Skincare products to Obagi\u2019s Southeast Asia in Vietnam, transactions with other Obagi Skincare distributors both within and outside the U.S., as well as certain other accounting items. As a result of the review, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, concluded that financial statements for certain Predecessor Periods should no longer be relied upon and should be restated. See \u201cItem 5. Waldencast\u2019s Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\u201d and \"Item 8. Financial Information- Note 2. Restatement and Reclassifications.\u201d in the Company\u2019s 2022 20-F filed with the SEC on January 16, 2024 for more information on the basis and impact of the restatement.\nSupplemental to the reported financial results set out in this section, management has also included certain key financial highlights for the business for the period covered in the H1 2023 Interim Financials which include non-GAAP measures which management uses to describe the underlying performance of the business.

Waldencast believes the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Waldencast believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends given the Business Combination and certain other factors. These non-GAAP measures also provide perspective on how Waldencast\u2019s management evaluates and monitors the performance of the business.\nThere are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from GAAP financial measures such as net income/loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nPlease refer to definitions set out in the release and the tables included in this release for a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nCombined Group Net Revenue is defined for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as the U.S. GAAP reported net revenue for Waldencast plc and is defined for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as the combined net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2022 for Obagi Skincare and Milk Makeup.

We believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required to be presented in accordance with GAAP because management believes they are non-core to our regular business. These include: (1) non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, inventory fair value adjustments, the amortization of fair value of the related party liability to Obagi China, change in fair value of financial instruments, loss on impairment of leases, and foreign currency transaction loss (gain); and (2) interest expense, income tax expense. In addition adjustments include expenses that are not related to our underlying business performance including (1) transaction-related costs which includes mainly legal expenses in connection with the Business Combination, including creating and maintaining the Up-C structure, as well as advisory and professional fees relating to the restatement and investigation; (2) non-operating gain due to a recovery of inventory and (3) other non-recurring loss.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of U.S. GAAP Net Revenue.\n\t\tSix months ended June 30, 2023\n(Successor)\t\t\tSix months ended June 30, 2022 (Predecessor)\t\nU.S. Dollars (in thousands)\t\tObagi\t\tMilk\t\tCentral\t\tWaldencast (Total)\t\t\tObagi\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNet Loss\t\t$\t(12,237\t)\t\t$\t(676\t)\t\t$\t(23,867\t)\t\t$\t(36,780\t)\t\t\t$\t(17,642\t)\t\nAdjusted For:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDepreciation and amortization\t\t\t20,725\t\t\t\t9,536\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t30,261\t\t\t\t\t7,140\t\t\nInterest expense\t\t\t5,978\t\t\t\t424\t\t\t\t3,209\t\t\t\t9,611\t\t\t\t\t5,702\t\t\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\t\t\t(4,510\t)\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t(4,509\t)\t\t\t\t(40\t)\t\nStock-based compensation expense\t\t\t990\t\t\t\t1,428\t\t\t\t3,058\t\t\t\t5,476\t\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\nTransaction-related costs(1)\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t10,624\t\t\t\t10,624\t\t\t\t\t4,038\t\t\nCOGS impact related to inventory fair value adjustment(2)\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t1,691\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t1,691\t\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\nChange in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities(3)\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t(1,122\t)\t\t\t(1,122\t)\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\nChange in fair value of interest rate collar(4)\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t(345\t)\t\t\t(345\t)\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\nAmortization of related party liability(5)\t\t\t(2,371\t)\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t(2,371\t)\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\nForeign currency transaction loss (gain)\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t315\t\t\t\t(17\t)\t\t\t303\t\t\t\t\t26\t\t\nInventory recovery(6)\t\t\t(1,500\t)\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t(1,500\t)\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\nProduct discontinuation(7)\t\t\t1,639\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t1,639\t\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\nLoss on impairment of lease\t\t\t767\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t767\t\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\nOther non-recurring costs\t\t\t159\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t\t159\t\t\t\t\t296\t\t\nAdjusted EBITDA\t\t$\t9,645\t\t\t$\t12,719\t\t\t$\t(8,460\t)\t\t$\t13,904\t\t\t\t$\t(480\t)\t\nNet Revenue\t\t$\t57,014\t\t\t$\t52,324\t\t\t$\t\u2014\t\t\t$\t109,338\t\t\t\t$\t68,250\t\t\nNet Loss % of Net Revenue\t\t\t(21.5\t)%\t\t\t(1.3\t)%\t\tN/A\t\t\t(33.6\t)%\t\t\t\t(25.8\t)%\t\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\t\t\t16.9\t%\t\t\t24.3\t%\t\tN/A\t\t\t12.7\t%\t\t\t\t(0.7\t)%\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n(1) Includes mainly legal, advisory and consultant fees related to the Business Combination and the financial restatement of the 2020-2022 periods.\n(2) Relates to the amortization of the inventory fair value step-up as a result of the Business Combination\n(3) Relates to change in fair value of warrant liabilities and not definitively related to operations\n(4) Relates to interest collar and not definitively related to operations\n(5) Relates to the fair value of the related party liability for the unfavorable discount to Obagi China as part of the Business Combination. \n(6) Relates to the costs to recover and the value of the inventory recovered from the acquisition of the Vietnam distributor which is not part of recurring operations.\n(7) Relates to the advanced purchase of specific products for the market in Vietnam sold through the Vietnam distributor that became obsolete when the contract was terminated.\n\t\tSix months ended June 30, 2023\tSix months ended June 30, 2022\t\n\t\tMilk\tMilk\t\nU.S. Dollars (in thousands)\t\t(Successor)\t(Predecessor)\t\n\t\t\t\t\nNet Income (Loss)\t\t$\t(676\t)\t$\t4,961\t\t\nAdjusted For:\t\t\t\t\nDepreciation and amortization\t\t\t9,536\t\t\t1,169\t\t\nInterest expense, net\t\t\t424\t\t\t21\t\t\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\t\t\t1\t\t\t9\t\t\nStock-based compensation expense\t\t\t1,428\t\t\t131\t\t\nTransaction-related costs(1)\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t1,584\t\t\nCOGS impact related to Inventory fair value adjustment(2)\t\t\t1,691\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\nForeign currency transaction loss (gain)\t\t\t315\t\t\t208\t\t\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets\t\t\t\u2014\t\t\t24\t\t\nAdjusted EBITDA\t\t$\t12,719\t\t$\t8,107\t\t\nNet Revenue\t\t$\t52,324\t\t$\t38,548\t\t\nNet Loss % of Net Revenue\t\t\t(1.3\t)%\t\t12.9\t%\t\nAdjusted EBITDA % of Net Revenue\t\t\t24.3\t%\t\t21.0\t%\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n(1) Includes mainly legal expenses in connection with the Business Combination.\n(2) Relates to the amortization of the inventory fair value step-up as a result of the Business Combination\n\nCombined Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA which combines (1) Adjusted EBITDA for Obagi Skincare for the period ended June 30, 2023 and the predecessor acquisition period for Obagi Skincare for the period ended June 30, 2022, (2) Adjusted EBITDA for Milk Makeup for the period ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 and (3) central costs for the period ended June 30, 2023.

The changing attitude of the population towards personal grooming is one of the factors driving the cosmetics industry and contributing to increased demand for nylon from these applications. Nylon microbeads are widely used in cosmetic and personal care cosmetics owing to their effectiveness as mattifying agents, binders, and oil-absorbing agents.\nNylon is widely used in the cosmetics industry. Products such as Nylon 12, Nylon 6, 12/6/66, 11, 66, 611, and 6/12 are used to formulate cosmetic products such as eye makeup, mascara, makeup products, nail polish, and skin fresheners.

    "text": "New York, United States, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chemicals used in personal care products range from the metallic salts and fatty acids found in common bath soaps to high-end cosmeceuticals that combine the cosmetic features of cosmetics with medicinal and chemical benefits. Personal care products are manufactured using personal care ingredients. Personal care chemicals can be derived from organic or synthetic sources. Various applications for personal care chemicals include hair care, skin care, oral care, cosmetics, etc. These chemicals can be utilized as anti-fungal, anti-aging, skin conditioning, anti-hair loss, hair conditioner, and shampoo, among other applications. People use personal care items to maintain or enhance their health and hygiene.\nDownload Free Sample Report PDF @ https://straitsresearch.com/report/personal-care-chemicals-market/request-sample\nGrowth in Sustainable Packaging Drives the Global Market\nEnvironmental consciousness primarily stimulates the expansion of sustainable packaging and processing operations. The personal care business has turned toward environmentally friendly packaging. In the personal care business, sustainable packaging is a trend that stays strong over the long term. It is part of an increasing trend toward eco-friendly and sustainable products. The penetration of sustainable packaging is greatest in Europe and North America, whereas claims in Asia-Pacific are far lower than in other regions.\nRecyclable packaging has been the most sought feature for sustainable packaging, followed by refillable bottles. For refillable items such as deodorant sticks and toothpaste tablets, brands such as Unilever have developed stainless steel and glass containers, double-walled steel containers, and aluminum containers. Materials may include paper and cardboard, corn starch, recycled polythene, or Plastarch Material (PSM). These packaging materials are biodegradable and eco-friendly. Hence, these factors are projected to drive market expansion.\nIncreasing Demand in Emerging Economies Creates Tremendous Opportunities \nA heightened awareness of healthy living has led to an increase in the per capita expenditure on household goods throughout Asia-Pacific. There is a growing demand for products that make certain claims, such as UV protection, long-lasting moisturization, organic, whitening, and anti-aging. In addition, companies have adopted product innovation as their primary approach to growing their geographical footprint and consumer base. The personal care market in India is driven by high disposable income, expanding awareness, and rising demand for herbal and organic goods. Further, the market for personal care products in Latin America is anticipated to grow due to shifting demographics, ongoing advancements, and a growing population. Innovation is the primary factor for the increase in sales. Since the complexion and hair of Latin Americans differ from those of Europeans, mass-produced products have proven useless. Nonetheless, due to innovation, brands have created items specific to the wants and demands of Latin Americans.\nCompetitive Players\nThe key players in the global personal care chemicals market are BASF SE, DOW, Solvay, Evonik, Clariant, Ashland, Croda International PLC, Lonza, Nouryon, Wacker Chemie AG, Innospec, Stepan Company, Merck KGaA, Corbion, The Lubrizol Corporation, Galaxy Surfactants, Sasol Limited, Adeka Corporation, Elementis PLC, Oxiterno, Kao Corporation, DSM, Eastman Chemicals Corporation, and Air Liquide and Givaudan.\nRegional Analysis\nAsia-Pacific personal care chemicals market share is anticipated to exhibit a CAGR of 4.13% during the forecast period. This is owing to the emergence of economies in Southeast Asia, such as India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, as well as the growth of disposable income in industrialized nations, such as Japan and China. The pandemic has affected the spending patterns and purchase preferences of Asian consumers, resulting in a minor decline in market growth due to the lockdown and closure of major retail shops. In addition, the region's desire for natural or organic products has increased due to a greater emphasis on health and well-being. These considerations have driven businesses to enhance their product lines in response to shifting consumer demands. Further, concerns about dryness, loss of volume, and other hair-related difficulties among younger Asian customers have spurred the expansion of the hair care sector as the prevalence of hair thinning increases.\nEurope is estimated to exhibit a CAGR of 4.0% over the forecast period. The personal care market in Europe has experienced significant growth over the past five years due to the increasing demand for younger-looking skin among males and females, the strengthening of distribution channels and promotional campaigns, and the growing consumer interest in personal care and wellness. Due to the rising demand for anti-aging and men's grooming goods, Germany is Europe's top revenue-generating nation. In addition, changing lifestyles and increased need for skincare products due to shifting weather conditions and growing demand for environmentally and animal-friendly products will contribute to expanding the personal care market throughout the forecast period. Furthermore, BASF and Clariant International, Dow Chemicals Company, Evonik Industries, and Solvay are market leaders. These businesses employ multiple techniques to increase market share and gain a competitive edge, propelling market expansion.\nKey Highlights\nBased on source, the global personal care chemicals market is bifurcated into organic and synthetic sources. The synthetic segment dominates the global market and is projected to exhibit a CAGR of 3.74% over the forecast period.\nBased on ingredients, the global personal care chemicals market is divided into rheology modifiers, emollients, surfactants, emulsifiers, and conditioning polymers. The emollient segment is responsible for the largest market share and is anticipated to exhibit a CAGR of 4.71% over the forecast period.\nBased on end-user, the global personal care chemicals market is segmented into skincare, hair care, oral care, cosmetics, and others. The skincare segment owns the highest market share and is estimated to boost at a CAGR of 4.21% during the forecast period.\nAsia-Pacific is the most significant global personal care chemicals market shareholder and is anticipated to exhibit a CAGR of 4.13% during the forecast period.\nMarket News\nIn March 2023, BASF Personal Care introduced KerasyliumTM, a new hair care component that assists in repairing damaged hair and shielding it from daily aggressions at in-cosmetics Global in Barcelona. Kerasylium is a microcomplex consisting of peptides and nutrients.\nIn March 2023, Reliance Consumer goods Limited (RCPL), the FMCG arm of Reliance Retail, announced introducing a home and personal care goods range on Wednesday, expanding its FMCG portfolio.\nGlobal Personal Care Chemicals Market: Segmentation\nBy Source\nSynthetics\nOrganic\nBy Ingredients\nEmollients\nSurfactants\nRheology Modifier\nEmulsifiers\nConditioning Polymer\nOthers\nBy End-User\nSkincare\nHair Care\nOral Care\nCosmetics\nOthers\nBy Regions\nNorth America\nEurope\nAsia-Pacific\nLatin America\nThe Middle East and Africa\nGet Detailed Market Segmentation @ https://straitsresearch.com/report/personal-care-chemicals-market/segmentation\nAbout Straits Research Pvt.

Over the first half of 2023, on a comparable basis, Milk Makeup delivered strong Combined Milk Net Revenue growth of +35.7% and Milk Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 million, compared with $8.1 million in the first half of 2022, a trend we saw continue into the second half of 2023. Obagi Skincare\u2019s performance was mixed with Net Revenue growth in the core U.S. physician dispensed business overshadowed by lower Net Revenue from the planned restructuring of certain channels in the U.S. and from operations in Southeast Asia due to the previously announced delays in obtaining product registrations. Shipments in Southeast Asia resumed in the second half of 2023, however, the ramp in revenue was slower than originally anticipated. That said, we are very excited about the growth prospects for the region as we establish a new and more robust go-to market structure for Obagi Skincare's business in Southeast Asia that will ramp up over the next 18 months.\u201d\n\u201cFor the full fiscal year 2023, we expect to deliver Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue growth in the mid-teens, and to yield significant advancement in profitability with Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the 10-12% range. While our fiscal 2023 results are expected to trail our original expectations, we believe that the changes made during 2023 will position us well to continue to achieve the on-going structural economics of our business model in 2024 with continued improvements of our Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Margin relative to 2023 guidance levels. This conviction is strengthened by the performance we have seen in the first couple of months of 2024 driven by strong innovation across both brands, particularly the launches of Milk Makeup Cooling Water Jelly Tints and Obagi Skincare's Hydro-Drops\u00aeEye Gel.\u201d\nFirst Half Fiscal 2023 Highlights\nOn July 27, 2022 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), Waldencast consummated the business combination (\u201cBusiness Combination\u201d) with Obagi Global Holdings Limited (\u201cObagi Skincare\u201d) and Milk Makeup LLC (\u201cMilk Makeup\u201d). The results below set out certain key performance highlights for the business for the periods presented in the H1 2023 Interim Financials. When reading the H1 2023 Interim Financials and this release, you should note there is a clear division between the \u201cpredecessor\u201d periods that include consolidated financial statements up to the Closing Date and \u201csuccessor\u201d periods that include all periods after the acquisition date. The predecessor and successor results shown on a U.S. GAAP basis are not comparable, as the successor period includes the consolidated financial statements of Waldencast, Obagi Skincare and Milk Makeup, whereas the predecessor period includes only Obagi Skincare\u2019s financial statements. We have included U.S. GAAP numbers for the period H2 2022 but note that they are presented primarily to inform the components of the non-GAAP metrics and do not allow for comparability for the periods presented for the reasons stated above. Please refer to our 2022 20-F filed with the SEC on January 16, 2024 for further information on our key accounting policies and restatements related to 2021 and 2020. Please also refer to the definitions and reconciliations set out further in this release with respect to certain adjusted non-GAAP measures discussed below which are included to provide an easier understanding of the underlying performance of the business given the above. \nWaldencast\nGroup Net Revenue: U.S. GAAP Net Revenue was $109.3 million in the first half of 2023, and $68.3 million in the first half of 2022.\nCombined Comparable Group Net Revenue: Removing the China Business and including Milk Makeup in the comparable period for the first half of 2022, Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue was $106.0 million in the first half of 2023, up 5.1% from $100.8 million in the first half of 2022.\nGroup Net Income/Loss and Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss was $(36.8) million during the first half of 2023, and $(17.6) million during the first half of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.9 million in the first half of 2023, and $(0.5) million during the first half of 2022.\nGroup Combined Adjusted EBITDA: Combined Adjusted EBITDA was $13.9 million (12.7% Adjusted EBITDA Margin) during the first half of 2023, compared with $7.6 million during the first half of 2022.\nObagi Skincare: For Obagi Skincare, U.S. GAAP Net Revenue was $57.0 million in the first half of 2023, compared with $68.3 million in the first half of 2022. Comparable Obagi Net Revenue was $53.7 million in the first half of 2023, down 13.8% vs. $62.2 million in the first half of 2022. The reduction in revenue was related primarily to the loss in revenue related to the Southeast Asia distributor (-$9.3m) and lower revenue recognized in connection with Obagi Skincare\u2019s Amazon distributor (-$2.2m) resulting from the decision to pivot to a direct distribution model and the termination of the agreement in place with the Amazon distributor. Offsetting these impacts, Obagi.com grew 80.9%, from $2.9 million in the first half of 2022 to $5.3 million in the first half of 2023 and International distributors (excluding Southeast Asia) grew 20.7% to $8.4 million in the same period. Obagi Skincare recorded a Net Loss of $(12.2) million in H1 2023. Obagi Skincare Adjusted EBITDA was $9.6 million (16.9% Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2023, compared with $(0.5) million (-0.7% Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2022 which was achieved in part due to the fact that revenue in the first half of 2023 from the Southeast Asia distributor had better margins as a result of the cash basis revenue recognition accounting compared to the first half of 2022 where margins were adversely impacted by shipments being greater than cash collected.\nMilk Makeup: For Milk Makeup U.S. GAAP Net Revenue was $52.3 million in the first half of 2023. Combined Milk Net Revenue was $38.5 million for the first half of 2022, resulting in a 35.7% growth across periods on a comparable basis. Milk Makeup recorded a Net Loss of $(0.7) million in H1 2023. Milk Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 million (24.3% Adjusted EBITDA Margin), compared with $8.1 million in the first half of 2022 driven by continued strong sales growth globally and improving gross margin.\nLiquidity: At June 30, 2023, Waldencast had $18.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $196.5 million. Total cash flow in the period January 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023 was $10.2 million, including a $35 million draw down on the revolving credit facilities. The revolving credit facility was fully repaid using the proceeds from the private placement conducted by Waldencast in September 2023 and remained undrawn until the end of fiscal 2023.\nOutstanding shares: As of June 30, 2023, the Company had 108,016,112 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 87,032,559 Class A ordinary shares outstanding and 20,983,553 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 122,076,410 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 101,228,857 Class A ordinary shares outstanding and 20,847,553 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. Fully Diluted Shares increased to 129,695,296 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily driven by 14,000,000 million additional Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the September 2023 private placement and 2,760,000 million ordinary shares granted as equity awards to employees. As of December 31, 2023, 70,245,039 Class A ordinary shares remain subject to contractual lock-up arrangements entered into in connection with the September 2023 private placement, of which (i) 10,401,884 were locked until March 14, 2024, (ii) 7,159,376 are locked until May 8, 2024, (iii) 31,205,649 are locked until September 14, 2024 and (iv) 21,478,130 are locked until November 8, 2024. Contractual lock-ups previously applying to former members of Milk Makeup and founders expired during the course of 2023. Further details regarding the duration of these lock-ups are set forth in our 2022 20-F.\nThe publication of the H1 2023 Interim Financials marks an important milestone for Waldencast in regaining compliance with Nasdaq reporting requirements and satisfaction of the conditions granted by the hearing panel. Waldencast looks forward to providing further updates on FY 2023 performance in connection with the publication of its 2023 20-F. In connection with the restatement of prior financial statements described in further detail below, Waldencast also published restated financials for Obagi Skincare for the period ended March 31, 2022 as required under securities regulations.\nObagi Skincare\nObagi Skincare is a flagship well established brand in the physician dispensed market, one of the most attractive sub-segments of premium skin care in the U.S. With its breakthrough technology and transformative clinically proven results, Obagi Skincare unlocks high loyalty from both consumers and physicians, and we believe is well positioned to answer the growing consumer need for high performance effective skin care, while also paving the way for Obagi Skincare to expand into other categories.\nIn the first half of 2023, Obagi Skincare reset its strategy and plans in the key strategic region of Southeast Asia through the acquisition of the Vietnam operations of the legacy Southeast Asia distributor and setting up the infrastructure to support a direct distribution model in the region, which is approximately 10 times the size of the Vietnam market. The skincare market in Southeast Asia is approximately $11 billion1 and growing rapidly and the Obagi Skincare brand has achieved widespread support from the dermatological community in the region. As part of this initiative, Obagi Skincare accelerated its organizational transformation in Southeast Asia with the appointment of a new management team. In connection with the restructuring of Obagi Skincare\u2019s business in Southeast Asia, in 2023 management also decided to discontinue the Obagi Clinical range and focus on selling the flagship Obagi Medical range in the region. Beyond Southeast Asia, a number of initiatives were also implemented during the course of 2023 designed to reposition the business for future success, led by a new management team which was announced in H2 2023.\nIn the first half of 2023 Obagi Skincare achieved U.S. GAAP Net Revenue of $57.0 million, compared with $68.3 million in the first half of 2022. Excluding sales from the China Business, Obagi Skincare delivered Comparable Obagi Net Revenue of $53.7 million in the first half of 2023, down 13.8% vs. $62.2 million in the first half of 2022. The reduction in revenue was related in part to the loss in revenue related to the Southeast Asia distributor (-$9.3m) and in part to lower revenue recognized in connection with Obagi Skincare\u2019s Amazon distributor (-$2.2m) resulting from the decision to pivot to a direct distribution model and the termination of the agreement in place with the Amazon distributor. Offsetting these impacts, Obagi.com grew 80.9%, from $2.9m million in the first half of 2022 to $5.3 million in the first half of 2023 and International distributors (excluding Southeast Asia) grew 20.7% to $8.4 million in the same period. Obagi Skincare recorded a U.S. GAAP Net Loss of $(12.2) million in the first half of 2023. Obagi Adjusted EBITDA was $9.6 million (16.9% Obagi Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2023, compared with $(0.5) million (-0.7% Obagi Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2022 which was achieved in part due to the fact that revenue in the first half of 2023 from the Southeast Asia distributor had better margins as a result of the cash basis revenue recognition accounting compared to the first half of 2022 where margins were adversely impacted by shipments being greater than cash collected.\nAs previously reported, in the first half of 2023, the Company implemented a series of initiatives relating to the Obagi Skincare business model in order to be better positioned to capture the opportunities in one of the fastest growing sub-segments of the skincare premium market. Obagi Skincare remains focused on the U.S. physician channel business, with a large healthcare professional account base consisting of more than 5,300 active medical provider accounts as of March 2024, and management estimates there are approximately 18,800 licensed physicians comprising licensed dermatologists and licensed cosmetic surgeons, resulting in broad distribution of Obagi products.\n__________________________\n\u00b9 Source: Sales value of skin care in Southeast Asia* (USD Million) in 2023, Euromonitor, KPMG Analysis.

Milk Makeup has built an organic following through a diverse and inclusive community known for its cultural relevance and iconic products. In the first half of 2023, Milk Makeup was the number 2 clean brand at Sephora U.S., bringing a relevant promise of cool, clean, makeup that works.\nThis translated into a strong financial performance with Milk delivering in the first half of 2023 U.S. GAAP Net Revenue of $52.3 million, a gross margin of 62.8% and Net Loss of $(0.7) million. Milk Adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 million (24.3%) in the first half of 2023, compared with $8.1 million in the first half of 2022 driven by continued strong sales growth globally and improving gross margin.\nIn the first half of 2023, Milk Makeup advanced on its key strategic goals via:\nSuccessfully bringing market leading innovation with two high profile launches Pore Eclipse Powder and Contouring Sticks (successful extension to existing strong Pillars Pore Eclipse and Sticks);\nDelivering high impact awareness by driving marketing campaigns both digitally on social media (e.g. TikTok) and through physical campaigns reaching their community in relevant touchpoints with relevant messaging; and\nExpanding into high demand markets such as the U.K. with the launch into Space NK and being a brand anchor of the highly publicized Sephora brick and mortar launch in the U.K.\nFinancial Overview \nIn accounting for the Business Combination, Waldencast was deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and Obagi Skincare was deemed to be the predecessor entity for purposes of financial reporting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, Waldencast\u2019s assets and liabilities retained their carrying values and the assets and liabilities associated with Obagi Skincare and Milk Makeup were recorded at their fair values measured as of the acquisition date, which created a new basis of accounting.\nWhen reading the H1 2023 Interim Financials and this release, you should note there is a clear division between the \u201cpredecessor\u201d periods that include consolidated financial statements up to the Closing Date and \u201csuccessor\u201d periods that include all periods after the acquisition date. The predecessor and successor results shown are not comparable, as the successor period includes the consolidated financial statements of Waldencast, Obagi Skincare, and Milk Makeup, whereas the predecessor period includes only Obagi Skincare\u2019s financial statements.\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, during the year ended December 31, 2023, management of the Company and the audit committee of Waldencast\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d), with the assistance of legal and accounting advisors, conducted an internal review of certain accounting issues related to the recognition of revenue in Predecessor Periods, including issues related to the recognition of revenue from sales of Obagi Skincare products to Obagi\u2019s Southeast Asia in Vietnam, transactions with other Obagi Skincare distributors both within and outside the U.S., as well as certain other accounting items. As a result of the review, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, concluded that financial statements for certain Predecessor Periods should no longer be relied upon and should be restated. See \u201cItem 5. Waldencast\u2019s Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\u201d and \"Item 8. Financial Information- Note 2. Restatement and Reclassifications.\u201d in the Company\u2019s 2022 20-F filed with the SEC on January 16, 2024 for more information on the basis and impact of the restatement.\nSupplemental to the reported financial results set out in this section, management has also included certain key financial highlights for the business for the period covered in the H1 2023 Interim Financials which include non-GAAP measures which management uses to describe the underlying performance of the business.

Waldencast believes the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Waldencast believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends given the Business Combination and certain other factors. These non-GAAP measures also provide perspective on how Waldencast\u2019s management evaluates and monitors the performance of the business.\nThere are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from GAAP financial measures such as net income/loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nPlease refer to definitions set out in the release and the tables included in this release for a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nCombined Group Net Revenue is defined for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as the U.S. GAAP reported net revenue for Waldencast plc and is defined for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as the combined net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2022 for Obagi Skincare and Milk Makeup. Under U.S. GAAP, Milk Makeup\u2019s pre-acquisition period should not be included for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

Management believes these non-GAAP comparative annual results provide a perspective on the on-going performance of the operations of the combined group. See the reconciliation under the definition of \u201cCombined Group Net Revenue\u201d.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before interest income or expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for the items as described in the reconciliation below. We believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required to be presented in accordance with GAAP because management believes they are non-core to our regular business.

The month prior, beverage giant Coca-Cola announced its first product sold exclusively on TikTok Shop, a drink dubbed Happy Tears Zero Sugar.\nTikTok is facing challenges in the U.S., between a possible nationwide ban on the app and its reportedly slowing user growth. Until this point, however, its growth has seemed astronomical.\nAdditionally, the platform is raising costs for sellers after a period of high discounting to drive engagement. \nOn Monday (April 1), TikTok posted its \u201cTikTok Shop Referral Fee Updates \u2013 2024,\u201d which shared that it is raising its referral fees (the service fee it charges sellers) from 2% to 6%, with the rate set to rise to 8% in July. This could affect the marketplace\u2019s growth rate going forward, as sellers are put in a position where they may have to charge more for their products.\nAs of December, TikTok had reportedly generated $10 billion in consumer spending, becoming the first non-game mobile app to do so. Now, as reported at the start of this year, TikTok hopes to expand its U.S. eCommerce business to $17.5 billion this year.\nTikTok users tend to be highly engaged with the platform, spending significant amounts of time watching and interacting with content. This high level of engagement can increase the visibility of branded content and help brands connect with their target audience in a more meaningful way. Plus, the app has a thriving community of influencers who have built large and loyal followings. Collaborating with these influencers can help brands reach their target audience more effectively and build credibility and trust with potential customers.\nMoreover, TikTok has become a trend-setting platform, with content often going viral and influencing popular culture. Brands that are active on TikTok can capitalize on trends and leverage them to increase brand awareness and engagement.\nIndeed, the opportunity here is significant, per data from the PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cTracking the Digital Payments Takeover: Monetizing Social Media,\u201d created in collaboration with Amazon Web Services.\nThe study, which drew from a census-balanced survey of nearly 3,000 U.S. consumers, found that 43% of consumers browse social media to find goods and services. However, only 14% ultimately purchase those goods and services via social media. Among the 39 million consumers browsing products and reviews via TikTok, the findings showed, 17% purchased what they found.\nDespite the uncertainties surrounding TikTok\u2019s future, the challenges it faces and the changes to the platform, brands are pressing forward, recognizing the immense potential of tapping into the app\u2019s vast, young shopper base to create new purchasing opportunities.\nSee More In: e.l.f.
